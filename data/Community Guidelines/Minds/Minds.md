Content Policy
==============

 The goal of Minds is to have fair, transparent and ethical moderation practices. 

 To ensure that decisions are made as democratically as possible, we developed a Jury System based on the Santa Clara Principles to review appeals. A Jury consists of 12 randomly selected unique active Minds users who are not subscribed to the user under review. Each juror selected is provided with the option to participate, pass or opt\-out of the Jury pool entirely. If 75% or more of the Jury members vote to accept the appeal of a strike, the administrative action is overturned. 

 If less than 75% of the Jury members vote accept the appeal, the administrative action is upheld. The decision of the Jury will be final. For more information about the jury system, read our blog. 

The current content moderation system functions as follows:

1. User reports content or channel
2. Minds staff accepts or rejects report
3. If accepted, user is notified and given chance to appeal
4. If appealed, a jury of Minds users votes on appeal

Strike Offense
--------------

 Users will receive a strike for certain violations of the Content Policy. Users will be notified about the strike, which term was violated, and which piece of content was in violation. All strikes can be appealed to a Minds Jury. Individual strikes will expire after 90 days. 

The following violations will result in a strike:

 **Untagged NSFW Post** (three strikes required for each individual NSFW category) 

* Strike 1 \- Warning
* Strike 2 \- 2nd Warning
* Strike 3 \- Full channel marked with NSFW category

**Harassment and Spam**

* Strike 1 \- Warning
* Strike 2 \- 2nd Warning
* Strike 3 \- Ban

 NSFW (not safe for work) is defined as content containing nudity, pornography, profanity, violence, gore, or sensitive commentary on race, religion, or gender. In general terms, it is defined as content which a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing, in a public setting, such as in a workplace. These tags can be applied to individual content or any group or channel. The full channel will not be marked with a NSFW category until it has received 3 strikes in a single NSFW category. 

 Spam on Minds is generally defined as repeated, unwanted, and/or unsolicited actions, automated or manual, that negatively affect Minds users, groups, and/or Minds itself. Spam also includes content that is designed to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing). Spam may result in an immediate ban if determined to be malicious or by use of a bot. 

 Spam may result in an immediate ban if determined to be malicious or by use of a bot. 

Immediate Ban Offense
---------------------

 Users will be immediately banned for certain violations of the Content Policy. Users will be notified about the ban and which term was violated, but they will not be able to see the content that was in violation as it will have to be removed from Minds. Appeals on immediate bans will be reviewed by the Minds admins and not a jury due to the nature of the content. 

* Illegal (terrorism, paedophilia, extortion, fraud, revenge porn, sex trafficking)
* Personal and confidential information (doxxing)
* Malware
* Impersonation
* Incites a true threat of violence

Boost Policy
------------

 Boost is the advertising network on Minds. Users may exchange Minds Tokens to “Boost” their content and receive views and increased interaction from the network. It is against the content policy to boost content that: 

* Violates Terms of Service
* Is tagged NSFW
* Sells Minds Tokens
* Qualifies as a Help and Support Request
* Exceeds Boost rate limits
* Appeals on a moderation decision
* Contains content from a banned user

 In addition, boosts will be rejected if the on\-chain payment failed or the original post has been removed. 

 If you would like to appeal a Boost rejection, you may do so by submitting a support ticket with the post in question and the reasons for why you believe it should be accepted. 

Minds\+ premium content policy
------------------------------

 Minds\+ aims to create a unique and engaging feed for its users, and to this end we require that any content monetized through Minds\+ is original and exclusive to Minds\+. We will not monetize content that exists anywhere else on the internet. 

 We adhere to US copyright law, including the concepts of "fair use" or "threshold of originality." We will not monetize content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others or violates any laws, including copyright, trademark, or privacy laws. 

 To meet the "threshold of originality" standard, content must be sufficiently creative and original. We reserve the right to determine whether content meets this standard. 

 Other restrictions on monetized content also apply. See the full Minds monetization terms for more details. 

Dos:

* Post original status updates and blogs
* Post original images and videos
* Post original memes derivative of pre\-existing memes

Don'ts:

* Re\-post memes, photos, videos, or other content others created
* Post content to Minds\+ that is available outside of Minds\+
* Post NSFW content to Minds\+

 If you believe that your content has been wrongly rejected or removed, you may contact our support team to appeal the decision. However, we reserve the right to make the final determination regarding the eligibility of content for monetization on Minds\+. For more, please see the Minds Monetization terms of service. 

### Violations

* First violation \- Content loses Minds\+ premium content status \& a strike is earned
* Second violation \- Content loses Minds\+ premium content status \& a strike is earned
* Third violation \- Content loses Minds\+ premium content status \& offender loses the ability to publish Minds\+ premium content

Spam Policy
-----------

 Spam is not allowed on Minds. Spam may take many forms, and our rules are intended to cover a range of prohibited behavior, including: Repeated, unwanted, and/or unsolicited actions, automated or manual, that negatively affect Minds users, groups, and/or Minds itself; Content that is designed to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing); Commercially\-motivated spam, that typically aims to drive traffic from Minds over to another website, service or initiative through backlinking or other inauthentic methods; Inauthentic engagements, that try to make channels or content appear more popular than they are; Coordinated activity, that attempts to artificially influence opinion through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, and/or scripting or automation. In most cases, spam will result in a strike for your channel. In cases where token manipulation by means of inauthentic engagement is identified, withdrawals will be rejected without refund as per the Terms of Service.
