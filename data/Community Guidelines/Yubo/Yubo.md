**Overview**
------------

Millions of people around the world use Yubo every day to socialize online and build authentic friendships. In line with our company values of openness, safety and privacy, we work hard to provide a safe space where our users can be themselves, without the pressure of followers and ‘likes’. 

Because many Yubo users are teenagers and young people, we have a special responsibility for their safety on the app and we take this very seriously. We educate, support and protect members of the Yubo community through innovative technology, a 24/7 team of safety experts, and Community Guidelines. We also have an independent Safety Board made of industry experts and work with NGOs, charities, law enforcement authorities and other organisations on digital safety issues.

The Yubo community plays a vital role in making our app a friendly and inclusive environment and we believe this starts with being welcoming and respectful. Our Community Guidelines set the standards and expectations necessary to protect the community and promote an atmosphere of inclusion, sharing and connecting; they outline what is allowed and what is not allowed on Yubo. Every new user must accept these guidelines when they sign up to the app. 

As you will see below, our Community Guidelines include rules about nudity, violence, drugs, hate speech, fake profiles and bullying. When someone violates these guidelines, we investigate and take the appropriate action – this might include sending a warning, filtering and removing content or suspending a user. We encourage our users to report any concerns to us and our own algorithms also generate reports when they detect a possible breach of our guidelines, so we can take action.

Our Community Guidelines apply to all our users, wherever they are in the world and whether they are posting content (including text, images, video live streaming and audio) on their profile, live\-streaming or chatting on Yubo. Because things change so fast in the digital world, these guidelines are a living document that we update regularly.

If you would like to find out more about our commitment to user safety and the tools we provide, please visit our Safety Hub. You can also find details of the actions taken by our Safety team in our Transparency Report. 

**Our Community Guidelines**
----------------------------

### **Age and identity**

To keep the Yubo community authentic and reduce the risk of online abuse, it is vital that our users are who they say they are. We expect everyone to provide real information about themselves at sign\-up and we carry out checks on these personal details to verify their age and identity.

When you set up your Yubo profile, you must provide the following information:

* Your date of birth (you must be at least 13 years old to use Yubo)
* Your name
* The gender you identify with (we offer 35\+ gender identities and 50 pronouns)
* A photo that shows your face clearly

Your Yubo account should be yours only (not a joint account that you share with someone else) and should not be used to impersonate someone else.

We verify your age and identity in a number of ways, including:

* Using age estimation tool
* Offering you the opportunity to have your ID checked (e.g. passport, driving license) to get a yellow ‘verified’ badge for your profile

If you provide incorrect personal details (i.e. lie about your age) or pretend to be someone you are not, we may ban you from Yubo.

You can find further details about our age and identity verification processes in our Safety Hub. If you are concerned that someone on Yubo is not who they say they are, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Nudity and sexual content and behaviours**

Certain types of content and behaviours may be inappropriate for our community and put the users that partake in it at risk \- especially when this involves minors. As a result, we do not allow content involving nudity, including partial nudity (e.g. images of topless users, users wearing very revealing clothing, underwear, or swimwear out of context). Pornographic, sexual and suggestive content as well as very sexual comments and discussions in lives are also prohibited.  

Our Safety Hub contains advice about sexual content and sexual exploitation and details of how we monitor and moderate Yubo. If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Bullying, harassment and other abusive behaviors**

We expect everyone in the Yubo community to interact with other users in a respectful manner. Bullying, harassment or any behaviors that could cause harm or make other users feel uncomfortable or unsafe are not tolerated. This includes mockery, name\-calling, spreading rumours, sharing personal information or private content, and all other behaviours that could cause intentional harm to others.

Additionally, we do not tolerate sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances towards other Yubo users. This includes any behaviours targeting other users with unwanted sexual behaviours, content, comments and requests, as well as the sharing or threatening to share another user’s private information or intimate images without the consent of this user.

If you need advice about bullying or inappropriate sexual behaviour or if you want to know how we monitor and moderate Yubo, visit our Safety Hub. If you are concerned about any content or behaviour on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Discrimination, hate and extremism**

Everybody should be able to feel safe and comfortable to be themselves on Yubo. We do not tolerate violent, hateful, discriminatory or abusive behaviors targeted towards another person or group of people on the basis of their race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or a disability or health condition. 

We also do not allow the glorification of ideologies or groups that promote hateful and violent ideas \- this includes sharing terrorist or extremist propaganda or expression of support for these ideologies, groups and people that represent them, as well as posting symbols and slogans associated with these ideologies. 

Our Safety Hub contains advice about hate speech and how we monitor and moderate Yubo. If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Violence and graphic content**

Violence has no place within the Yubo community. We prohibit behaviours that could result in real life violence, such as threats, incitement to violence or glorification of violence. We will also report to Law Enforcement situations involving an imminent or realistic risk of real life violence. Additionally, we do not allow content that depicts violent acts, weapons or content that is graphic or gory in nature. 

If you want to find out more about how we monitor and moderate Yubo, visit our Safety Hub. If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

**Child sexual exploitation and abuse**
---------------------------------------

In order to keep our young users safe, we take a zero tolerance approach towards child sexual abuse and exploitation and have developed a set of policies and guidelines to proactively identify and respond to these risks. Any behavior that involves or could lead to the sexual abuse and exploitation of minors, whether online or in real life, is prohibited; this includes child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and trafficking, grooming, the sharing of unsolicited obscene material with minors, as well as child sexual abuse material. Users engaging in these behaviours will be banned from Yubo, and the violation they committed may be reported to the appropriate authorities. 

For more information about grooming and sexual exploitation or if you want to know how we monitor and moderate Yubo, visit our Safety Hub. If you are concerned about any content or behaviour on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Privacy Violations**

Every Yubo user has the right to privacy; we do not allow members of our community to share or access other people’s personal information, such as their full name, home address, phone number, email or social media details, or personal photos and videos without prior permission. 

Read our Privacy Policy or visit our Safety Hub to learn how we monitor and moderate Yubo.

If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Platform misuse and fraudulent activity**

Yubo is a platform to socialize and make new friends – it is not a marketplace, nor a dating app. We do not allow users to advertise, offer and promote services and goods in exchange for money or other goods, or collecting funds from other users \- especially when it comes to illegal or regulated products and services. 

Impersonation, scamming, blackmail, sexual extortion (or “sextortion”), hacking and any attempt to wrongfully access information or money from other users or Yubo itself are prohibited. If you engage in illegal behaviors, we may permanently suspend your account and depending on the severity, escalate to Law Enforcement.

Visit our Safety Hub to find out how we monitor and moderate Yubo. If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Harmful behaviours**

We care deeply about the safety of our users. We take action if members of our community encourage others, especially younger users, to engage in harmful behaviors during Lives or elsewhere on the platform, and if harmful content is shared. We therefore do not allow the consumption of drugs and alcohol during a live, as well as content depicting these behaviours. Challenges, games and behaviours that could result in a user getting injured or putting themselves at risk are also prohibited.

Visit our Safety Hub to find out how we monitor and moderate Yubo. If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

### **Self harm**

Young people may use Yubo to seek out friendship and find support when they navigate a difficult time; being able to provide this space is very important to us, but in order to keep our community a safe space for everyone, we may have to take action in situations involving risk of self harm or suicide. Should we believe that a user intends to harm themselves, we may reach out to provide resources and report the situation to Law Enforcement so they can receive adequate support.  Additionally, we do not allow content that depicts, encourages or promotes self\-harm, eating disorders, and suicide to other Yubo users. 

If you need advice about self harm and suicide or if you want to know how we monitor and moderate Yubo, visit our Safety Hub. If you are concerned about any content or behavior on Yubo, please report it to us – tap the shield icon in the app and select ‘Report’.

**Enforcement Approach**
------------------------

As a member of the Yubo community, you must agree to adhere to our Community Guidelines. If we receive a report of a violation of these guidelines (either from another user or generated by our own algorithms), we investigate and take appropriate action on the basis of our guidelines. Our response will depend on how severe the violation is and the level of risk it poses for other Yubo users. 

User reports are reviewed by safety specialists. We use automated tools to execute certain moderation actions (e.g. to take immediate action before any harm is done). More serious actions, such as a ban, are decided by safety specialists.

We take the following enforcement approach:

* In most minor cases, we focus on educating the user about how they have crossed the line, how to change their behavior and warn them of the additional actions we may take on their accounts if they do not comply.
* Some violations require us to remove content (e.g. from a user's profile), close a video stream, or temporarily restrict access to a feature in our app.
* In more severe cases and where someone is repeatedly violating our Community Guidelines, we may temporarily suspend their Yubo account or permanently ban them from our platform.
* Attempting to get around a suspension (e.g. by creating a new account) is not allowed and may result in further action, including longer suspensions or even a permanent ban.
* In instances involving a reporting obligation, potential illegal behaviour on Yubo or an emergency situation, we may work with law enforcement and other relevant entities to take additional action.

Our Transparency Report provides details of the actions we took when our Community Guidelines were violated. 

**Our Commitment to Human Rights**
----------------------------------

At Yubo, we seek to provide a space for young people to express themselves freely, while still prioritising their safety and privacy. We are committed to protecting human rights and to following the principles set up in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and we have made Safety and Privacy our core values. 

Our commitment to human rights is a key consideration during the development and drafting of our Community Guidelines, as well as in their day\-to\-day application, whether in the context of content moderation or proactive detection. These guidelines and processes are informed by academic research, industry and institutional best practices, as well as the expertise of our Safety board; this ensures that specific attention is paid to the impact of these guidelines on more vulnerable or marginalised members of our community. 

Our consideration to Human Rights and our values is further reflected in additional ways:

* Our commitment to Safety and Privacy extends to our internal ways of working, through our Privacy Policy, Child Protection Policy and Whistleblowing Policy.
* Our bi\-annual Transparency Reports provide visibility on how our community guidelines are applied in practice, as well as data on our collaboration with Law Enforcement in the context of data requests or proactive reporting;
* Our Privacy policy



Advice
------

### Introduction

Yubo was created to make it easy for young people to meet new friends from around the world in as safe an online environment as possible. Here we will share helpful information and tips on staying safe online, common issues that can occur on social media platforms, and what we’re doing to help our users explore Yubo as safely as possible. Check out our Teen’s Guide (for users) and Parent’s Guide (for parents, educators, and caretakers) for more information and helpful resources.

**Issues that can take place on social media platforms**

We know the online world can feel overwhelming, especially with how quickly and constantly it is changing. Here are some issues that can take place on social media platforms, and how we at Yubo approach them to keep our community as safe as possible. 

### Bullying

Bullying can be hurtful and scary, whether it’s online or in the real world. On social media, bullying can take many forms, including hateful comments and photos or videos being shared without permission. 

Online bullying (also referred to as cyberbullying) can be particularly upsetting for young people. Bullying of any kind is not acceptable on Yubo. In our Community Guidelines, we ask our users to respect one another, and we make it clear that we have a zero\-tolerance policy for bullying, intimidating, threatening or harassing another user on our platform.

Our Safety Specialists who monitor activity on Yubo 24/7 provide a warning and take appropriate action when instances of bullying are reported by users or detected through our textual and audio\-moderation technologies.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Encourage your teen or students to respect other people online – that includes considering whether something they say might be hurtful and standing up for anyone they see being bullied.
* Explain to them that it’s not their fault if someone is harassing or bullying them.
* Discuss how they can make the most of Yubo’s safety tools (e.g. to block people).
* Reassure them that they should come to you if they are being bullied and that you’ll support them.

(For Teens)

* It’s not your fault – do your best not to let someone else decide how you should view yourself.
* Talk to someone you trust, it’s hard to feel alone when you’re going through a tough time.
* Take advantage of our safety tools (here’s a list of some of them!), remember that you can block a user if you’d rather not be friends with them or report a user if you don’t feel comfortable.
* Stand up for others when you see them being bullied if you feel comfortable, and if not please report it to our Safety Specialists so they can investigate and take action to keep our community as safe as possible.
* Here are some helpful resources if you or someone you know is being bullied.
### Inappropriate language

The way people communicate changes all the time, and we understand that sometimes it’s difficult to understand which words, phrases and emojis are harmless and which could be seen as offensive or inappropriate. Inappropriate language can take many forms, ranging from hate speech to swear words and other explicit language. 

At Yubo, we place a large importance on staying up to date with the latest trends and language used online. We regularly review and update a list of terms, phrases and emojis that violate our Community Guidelines, which are automatically filtered out and removed from the platform. 

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Remind your teen or students why it’s important to respect other people online – using rude or nasty language on Yubo could easily offend or upset someone and might also break our Community Guidelines.
* Look up some of the language young people use on social media so that you understand what they are talking about – the more you know about how they use social platforms like Yubo, the better.
* Think about the kind of language and emojis you use on your own social media, especially if your teen has access to it.
* Let us know about any offensive or inappropriate language on Yubo so that we can investigate. If a user breaches our Community Guidelines, we’ll remove the content and notify the user about why it’s not allowed.

(For Teens)

* Remember that the Internet is written in ink, not pencil \- it lives forever so please think twice before you use inappropriate language.
* Be mindful of how the language you use may affect others.
* Try your best to be aware of the meaning of the words you use – whether historically or recently, a lot of explicit language has a hateful intention or background.
### Hate speech

Hate speech is abusive or offensive language targeted at a group or person due to or on the basis of their race, gender, religion, nationality, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. Hate speech can show up in the form of trolling, cyberbullying or even threats of violence.

Being a victim of hate speech – or even witnessing it – can be very upsetting and confusing, especially because hateful comments can often escalate quickly online. 

We have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech and discrimination on our platform. We have a number of safety tools in place, including audio moderation and textual detection, to help protect our users against hate speech. If a crime has been committed, we work closely with the relevant law enforcement agencies.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Have a conversation with your teen or students about the importance of inclusivity and being kind to others online – you might like to remind them about our Community Guidelines, which they accepted when they signed up to Yubo.
* Encourage them to be vigilant and to think carefully before they post and before they share someone else’s posts (Does it attack or discriminate against someone? Might it break the law?).
* Discuss the various tools available on Yubo to help protect young people, such as the ‘block user’ option in their profile settings.
* Explain how hate speech might be considered a hate crime and why it’s important that they report any incidents on the Yubo platform so that we can take action.

(For Teens)

* If you’re currently experiencing hate speech or you’ve noticed hate speech taking place, please report it to our Safety Specialists using the in\-app report tool or at this link so we can take the appropriate action \- try to attach media files, such as screenshots, so we have as much context as possible.
* Remember that we have a number of safety tools that allow you to decide who you want to interact with while on Yubo, you can always block a user if you don’t want them sending you messages or joining your Lives anymore.
* Being abusive or offensive to others can be extremely hurtful, think about whether you’d want to be spoken to in the same way you’re considering speaking to others.
* Hate speech can also be considered a hate crime, keep this in mind before using this language on Yubo or anywhere else.
* Here are some helpful resources if you or someone you know is a victim of hate speech.
### Harmful and illegal content

**Harmful and illegal content**

Your teen or students may come across illegal, harmful or inappropriate content online, such as violence, drugs, pornography, gambling, and criminal activity. We do not allow content of this nature on Yubo, and we take it down as soon as we become aware of it. 

When required, if we come across content or behaviors in violation of the law we refer it to the relevant authorities so that they can further investigate as needed.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* **Read our advice about hate speech and our** Community Guidelines.
* Talk openly with your teen or students about the kind of content that could be harmful or illegal.
* Encourage them to let you know if they come across any messages or posts on Yubo that worry them.
* Discuss why it’s important to not share this kind of content with other Yubo users.
* Report any harmful or potentially illegal content to us so we can take action (e.g. remove the content, suspend the user’s account and report it to law enforcement).

(For Teens)

* Take the time to understand what kind of content could be harmful or illegal \- we have a whole section on this in our Community Guidelines.
* Report any harmful or potentially illegal content, whether it’s directed at you or others, so we can take action.
* If you can, talk to an adult that you trust so they’re aware of what you’re going to and can help you.
* Here are some helpful resources on how to seek help and for the different types of harmful or illegal content you may come across online.
### Peer Pressure

From just\-for\-fun pranks to more serious challenges that encourage risky behavior, such as bullying others or participating in viral video dares, it’s common to feel pressure from others online.

It’s not always easy to say no, but it’s important to understand the consequences or repercussions. Our Community Guidelines make it clear that certain types of behavior are not OK on Yubo. For minor infractions of our Community Guidelines, we take an educational approach recommended by experts to teach our users about online safety best practices, respectful online behavior and accountability. For more serious violations, we have the option to remove content and suspend a user's account temporarily or permanently depending on the severity of the infraction.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Talk to your teen or students about how to make positive decisions online and how to say no to their friends if they don’t want to do something.
* Explain that, just like in the real world, the way they behave online can have serious consequences – what starts off as a joke could have a negative impact on them and other people now and in the future.
* Report any inappropriate behaviour or content to the Yubo team so that we can take action.

(For Teens)

* Remember that you don’t *have* to do anything \- we know how stressful it can be to “fit in” so try your best to stand up for yourself and to act online as you would in real life.
* Take some time to understand that encouraging others to take part in risky behaviour could impact their life, and yours, forever.
* Report any inappropriate beahviour to our team of Safety Specialists so we can take action \- attach any screenshots or videos whenever you can so we have as much context as possible when investigating.
* Here’s our list of organizations that can help if you need support.
### Self\-esteem

In a world of curated content and unrealistic life and beauty standards everywhere you turn, young people often feel constant pressure to look and behave a certain way online. 

Our goal is for Yubo to be a space where our users feel confident and comfortable interacting  authentically, so we’ve eliminated likes and followers to help relieve the pressure they might experience on other platforms. This helps our users express themselves and connect with others as they would in real life and allows them to focus on meaningful interaction and building genuine friendships without the burdens of performance or comparison. Yubo’s zero tolerance policy for hurtful comments, bullying or any other similar behaviors also helps to protect our users’ self\-esteem. 

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Help your teen or students to understand that comparing themselves to celebrity influencers or getting fixated on the number of ‘likes’ and ratings they receive on social media isn’t healthy.
* Discuss why it’s important to be kind to other people online. Something that might seem like harmless fun (such as rating someone based on how attractive they are) **could have** serious consequences for the other person.
* Encourage them to be themselves and not be defined by what others think of them.

(For Teens)

* We don’t have ‘likes’ and ‘followers’ because we want to try to take away the pressures of social media \- our goal is for you to feel empowered to be authentic and build friendships that feel true to who you are.
* Remember that you are the only one who has the power to decide how you view yourself!
* Be kind to others and to yourself online and in the real world, you never know what someone else is going through.
* Here’s a list of organizations that can help if you need support.
### Wellbeing

Bullying, peer pressure, the COVID\-19 pandemic which brought about many new challenges, and other issues can have a significant impact on mental wellbeing. 

Staying connected to others is a great boost for mental health. Our aim at Yubo is for our users to build friendships and be a part of a community where they can belong, feel safe, and hang out.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Let your teen or students know you’re there for them if they’d like to discuss any concerns they have or if they need your support.
* Encourage them to get the online/offline balance right. You might find it useful to discuss the five ways to good mental wellbeing: connect with other people, be physically active, learn something new each day, give to others, pay attention to the present moment.

(For Teens)

* Talk to someone that you trust about what you’re going through and how you feel \- try to remember that you’re not alone, everyone has hard days.
* There’s lots of different ways to work towards good mental wellbeing, whether that’s connecting with other people, being physically active, learning something new each day, giving to others, or paying attention to the present moment \- find what works for you and see how you can incorporate it into your daily routine!
* Here’s a list of organizations that can help if you need support.
### Fake profiles and scams

Sometimes, people pretend to be someone else when they are online. They may set up fake social media profiles or try to convince users to send them personal information. Catfishing and other online scams can be disconcerting and upsetting, and could even put some at risk of identity theft.

To ensure our users are who they say they are, we have instated 100% platform\-wide age verification – a first for major social media platforms. If a user does not pass the age verification process, their profiles are shut down and when appropriate, reported to the relevant authorities.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Explain to your teen or students that Yubo asks for real information when setting up a profile **and encourages them to get verified by Yoti**. By not allowing our users to be anonymous, we can identify fake profiles more easily and take action against other inappropriate behaviour.
* Discuss why it’s important to be wary of profiles, photos and messages that seem too good to be true. Imposters are often keen to appear “perfect” so look out for model\-like photos, flattering comments and other suspicious behaviour.
* Make sure your teen or students know they haven’t done anything wrong if they fall for a fake profile. Some people can be very convincing.
* Let us know if you suspect a profile on Yubo could be fake so that we can take action.
* If a young person is concerned that someone has stolen their identity to set up a fake profile on Yubo, contact us so that we can remove it.

(For Teens)

* Be wary of profiles, photos and messages that seem too good to be true. Imposters are often keen to appear “perfect” so look out for model\-like photos, flattering comments and other suspicious behaviour \- if you feel someone isn’t who they say they are, please report the profile to us so we can investigate.
* Make sure not to send any personally identifiable information (this is called ‘PII’) such as your phone number or address to users that you don’t know personally.
### Grooming and sexual exploitation

Unfortunately, some individuals choose to target young people for the wrong reasons. They may set up fake profiles to start conversations or gain trust. At Yubo, we understand the importance of our users knowing who they’re talking to and being able to trust the communities they build online. It’s because of this that we require all of our users to undergo age verification in order to use Yubo. This helps to prevent bad actors or people with malintention from joining the platform and pretending to be an age that they’re not. We also have age gating in place to separate users into different communities based on age, so that we can limit interaction between teens and adults.

We have a zero tolerance policy for the sexual exploitation of young people and work closely with the National Center for Missing \& Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement agencies in the countries in which we operate to report every potential offender for further investigation.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Remind your teen or students to be careful about what they share online (e.g. phone number, address, social media profiles, photos, videos).
* Explain why verified profiles on Yubo (with a yellow badge) can help them to know that the person they are chatting to is who they say they are.
* Discuss how anyone can see livestreams on Yubo, not just their friends and get them to think carefully before filming themselves.
* Explain why no one should pressure them into doing something they don’t want to do – even if it’s someone they know.
* Encourage them to trust their instincts about people they meet online and to recognise that if what someone says to them seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* Look out for changes in your teen’s or students’ behaviour. Are they increasingly secretive about the devices and apps they use? Do they go to their room as soon as they receive a message or get defensive when you ask them who they are talking to?
* If your teen or students feel uncomfortable about someone who has approached them on Yubo, report it to us immediately. We pass the details of any potentially criminal activity to law enforcement and other agencies.

(For Teens)

* Be careful of what you share online, everything you post on the Internet can live forever \- so think twice before giving someone personally identifiable information (such as your phone number or address) or sending pictures or videos to people you don’t know.
* Remember anyone can see livestreams on Yubo so think carefully before joining a Live.
* Trust your instincts about people you meet online, if someone makes you feel uncomfortable or something doesn’t seem right \- report it to us so we can investigate and take the appropriate action.
* Here’s a list of organizations that can help if you need support.
### Nudity and sexting

Flirting, exploring sexual feelings and having relationships are a natural part of growing up. It can be difficult to know where to draw the line when sharing photos and videos. Celebrities posting pictures in their underwear and the increasingly sexual images and behaviour in the media can make it confusing. 

Some may feel pressured into sharing nude pictures by their boyfriends, girlfriends, friends, or strangers pretending to be someone else, while others may be trying to get attention or in hopes of achieving another goal. It’s important to understand that these types of photos and videos can be shared with others without consent and could put the individual at risk of sexual exploitation. With users below the age of 18, taking, sharing or possessing these images is unlawful and illegal. 

To help protect our younger users, we detect every photo or video that contains nudity and prevent it from being uploaded on Yubo. We also send a pop\-up alert if there is nudity in a livestream and we have the option to disable the Live and/or ban the user. 

We make it clear in our Community Guidelines that nude and sexual images are not allowed on our platform and that we take steps to remove them as soon as we are aware of them. 

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Encourage your teen or students to think carefully before they post or share any images on social media or take part in a livestream. Could their behaviour hurt them or someone else or even be illegal?
* Talk to them about the possibility of other people (perhaps even someone they trust, like a boyfriend or girlfriend) sharing nude images of them online and what they should do if this happens.
* Explain to your teen or students that they could be breaking the law if they take, share or possess nude images of themselves or other under\-18s.

(For Teens)

* Think carefully about what you share on social media and with others, do you feel comfortable with someone having an intimate picture of you forever?
* Remember that anyone (even someone you trust) could share any nude images you share with them online or with others.
* Understand that you are breaking the law if you take, share, or possess nude images of yourself or others under the age of 18\.
* If someone is sharing nude images of you, our partners at NCMEC have developed a privacy\-friendly tool called ‘Take It Down’ to help.
* Please report to us if you know of anyone sharing nude images of yourself or others.
### Self\-harm and suicide

Some people experience depression and low self\-esteem, or face other complex personal challenges. Being part of an online community can help users who might be struggling mentally or emotionally by giving them a strong network of support. The opportunity to meet and connect with others who might be going through something similar or can sympathize can help with feeling less alone. While this is one of the greatest benefits of socializing online, in some cases, users may be encouraged by others to participate in unhealthy or dangerous behaviors such as self\-harm or suicide. 

If we see this type of behavior taking place on Yubo, we intervene immediately. We assess the situation and offer support to the user, including putting them in touch with a local helpline or in more severe cases, informing law enforcement so that they can perform a wellness visit.

***Our advice***

(For Parents)

* Reassure your teen or students that you’re there for them and that you’ll help them to get support.
* Take a look at our list of Resources for support organizations in your region, and if you’re comfortable, share these with your teen too \- it’s always helpful for them to know they’re not alone.
* Encourage them to look out for friends who might be struggling.
* Read our Community Guidelines and report any posts on Yubo about self\-harm and suicide so that we can take the appropriate action. We respond immediately to reports of emergencies and contact the police and support agencies where necessary.

(For Teens)

* Talk to someone that you trust about what you’re going through and how you feel \- try to remember that you’re not alone, everyone has hard days.
* Here is a list of organizations that can help and provide support if you’re struggling.
* Look out for others who may also be having a hard time and help them get support.
