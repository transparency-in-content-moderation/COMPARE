===================================

 Let's put aside the legal language and dispel all doubts. In front of you is a list of things that are advisable and prohibited on the Kickoff.

 10 "yes"
--------

 

---

 ### YES - Add

 Share interesting Finds. Remember, Wykop is created by users and it's up to you to decide what kind of content makes it to our site.

 ### YES ̶ Comment.

 Share your opinions and point of view. We want to know your opinion and find out what you like and why. This will help us to better shape the service according to users' tastes.

 ### YES ̶ Discuss.

 The Dig Community is full of interesting people. Talk, meet and socialize with them! If you want to meet live, keep up to date with our announcements ƒ- don't let you miss the Wykop Party we organize!

 ### YES ̶ Browse

 See what others are interested in, check out what's happening on the Internet. Stay up to date with the news. If you haven't been on Wykop for a while, open the "Hits" tab and see which links have been most popular.

 ### YES Dug.

 By digging out, you will not only help us to create a ranking of the most interesting Finds, but you will also easily find your way back to your favorite content ̶ all the links you have dug out can be found in your profile.

 ### YES ̶ Watch.

 Add users who add Findings of interest to your followers. Create your own network of people you have a lot in common with.

 ### YES ̶ Describe and tag.

 Remember to describe, tag and categorize your Finds well, so that they can be easily found among the dozens of links added every day. A good description also has tremendous marketing power ̶ if you want your Find to be dug up by a lot of people, take the time to write it correctly, factually and without excessive use of Caps Lock.

 Also remember to label embeddable broadcasts, videos or other messages well in terms of possible negative effects on the development of minors in particular age categories. The rules for labeling such content are set forth in Appendix 2 to the Rules. In order to protect minors, we hide some content for users who have not registered and declared their age of majority.

 ### YES ̶ Inform.

 Has a blatant example of a violation of the Rules caught your eye? Notify us using the "report" function visible next to each Find and Comment or by contacting us using the contact form. We will respond as soon as possible, within the time limit specified in the Rules! If you disagree with the decision, remember that the matter can be resolved amicably. If the submission concerns content in the form of links to broadcasts, videos or other transmissions, embedding on Wykop, the mediator may be an individual, registered in the list of mediators kept by the Chairman of the National Broadcasting Council. You are also entitled to legal remedies, in particular those specified in the Regulations.

 ### YES ̶ Advertise

 But only by agreement with us! Report to the advertising department and see what we can offer your brand. Do not run an advertising campaign on Wykop on your own. Such pushy actions are not well perceived by the community and end up with your account being banned.

 When placing commercial messages in broadcasts, videos and other messages embed on Wykop, follow the rules set forth in Appendix 3 to the Terms of Service.

 ### YES ̶ Have fun!

 What's really at stake here is great entertainment. Wykop.pl is a site for people like you, so have fun here!

 10 "no"

 ### Don't get bored

 Add only Finds worthy of attention. Uninteresting content will not find followers here.

 ### Don't duplicate

 Always check if the Find you are adding is not already on Wykop. Our duplicate search engine will help you with this. Don't try to cheat by changing the link of the Finding - when we say it was there, we mean it was there!

 ### Don't manipulate the votes

 Digging up one Finding from several accounts is cheating, which we do not tolerate. Have we blocked you even though you have nothing on your conscience? Write to us ### We will check if there was a mistake. Incorrect selection of the reason for burial is also unwelcome.

 ### Do not add inappropriate content.

 Inappropriate content includes, but is not limited to, pornographic, racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, nationalistic, xenophobic, promoting drug use or violence and... many others that are illegal, threaten the proper development of minors, facilitate the commission of a crime, promote bad behavior or arouse negative feelings of the administration and users. For such content, depending on its overtones, there is a threat of several days or even permanent blocking of the account. Due to the contentious issue of what is and what is not inappropriate content, the final decision rests with the administration of Wykop, which may prevent access to the content. In some cases, if we deem that the content you have added is inappropriate, we may first ask you to remove it.

 The Ditch may prevent you from posting content in cases described in the Terms of Service. We give reasons for our decisions, and if you disagree with them, you have legal remedies, in particular those set forth in the Terms of Service. If you are entitled to complain to the National Broadcasting Authority, its Chairman may, by decision, order: prevent, restore access to content, restore to you the ability to embed broadcasts, videos or other transmissions.

 Remember also that the Internet is not anonymous! By breaking the law you expose yourself to civil as well as criminal liability.

 ### Do not add incorrect tags

 Various phrases are more or less popular on Wykop. Adding wrong tags or deliberately choosing the wrong Category to increase the popularity of your Find is particularly frowned upon by users, as it introduces a lot of clutter. It's like someone putting your pickle in a jar of your favorite candy because they figured that's where you'd find it before. You'll admit it yourself - it goes a long way toward pissing you off.

 ### Don't swear.

 Despite the fact that some Finds arouse extremely strong emotions, maintain the culture of speech. Remember that our Community is also made up of underage users ### Set a good example for them.

 ### Do not insult

 While we can turn a blind eye to minor swearing, we absolutely do not tolerate insulting anyone among the Diggers. Such behavior will result in a warning or blocking your account. Remember - we do not accept any excuses.

 ### Don't spam.

 Have your business and want to promote yourself on Wykop? Great! Apply to our advertising department! We will be happy to prepare something for you. Wykop is not a web directory, so pay attention to the content you add, and try to make it interesting and not come from one domain. Also considered spam are all other activities that are intended to promote one particular site or brand, such as a login containing a site address. Spammers are thanked. Permanently.

 ### Don't flood

 Many times we feel like sharing some of our golden thoughts with the world. This is absolutely understandable, as long as it is done once, of course. Flooding the site with one and the same content is unwelcome and punished accordingly, especially if it involves spam.

 ### Don't troll

 As is the case in nature, species of trolls are plentiful. All of them are equally insufferable and unpleasant to deal with, which is why we are usually told about trolls prowling the Digg by the users themselves. Milder species of trolls are usually treated with a warning, but for the more aggressive ones we have no mercy and their accounts are blocked.
