 Shills just like to say 8kun is dead for their usual reasons.

We follow the first amendment on 8kun, which has five parts.

Freedom of religion, Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and the right to redress grievances.

Suppose your posts are continually deleted. they may not be protected by freedom of speech. The usual types of posts which are not protected are advertising posts, posts that advocate violence, and posts that don't pass the dost test.

These are not the only posts that are not protected, but they do make up most of them.

If your post is within the advertising threshold, don't hesitate to contact 8kun about purchasing advertising if your post is one of the other categories. Please leave immediately. You are not welcome here.

Some folks imagine that each board and chat is free for all, and anything can be posted in it. That is not the case either.

There is a place for each thing, and if you can't find a place for what you want to say. Please make a new board just for your posts. Perhaps other people will have an interest in them. These boards and chats are all listed on the front of the website for easy access. This includes some with quite awful names. Please make sure your content is not against the law in the United States. This is our most important rule on 8kun.top.

BOs and BVs, please pay attention to this and note it. If the content does not belong on your board, you know that. The poster can find the board where it belongs. It is not the obligation of the BO or the BV to find the appropriate board for the poster. If that poster is posting random stuff, the post should be random, not on your board.

These examples should help you moderate the website and protect it from illegal content. Even though this doesn't cover all Global Rule violations, these are the most common bannable offenses on the site.

The mere act of LINKING or REQUESTING illegal content is a bannable offense. If you know the content is illegal, but you are unsure about the reason, please use the global rule as the ban reason:

"Do not post, request, or link to any content that is illegal in the United States of America and do not create boards with the purpose of posting or spreading such content."

https://8kun.top/globalrule.html

Do not edit posts as you become legally liable as the one who posted the content (because it counts as a repost). You don't want to be liable for someone else's posts.

Do not sticky anything.

If you believe you are biased about a certain issue, recuse yourself and leave the report up for someone else to take care of it (unless it's illegal content, in which case remove it as soon as possible).

 

 To avoid a global and / or local ban on 8kun's boards, do not upload images of real children, sexualized or not.

 But what is *sexualized*, really?

 From Wikipedia:

 
> The Dost test is a six\-factor guideline established in 1986 in the United States district court case *United States v. Dost* \[636 F. Supp. 828 (S.D.Cal. 1986\)].
> 
>  In order to better determine whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a "lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area" under 18 U.S.C. §2256(2\)(A), the court develoo ped six criteria. Not all of the criteria need to be met nor are other criteria necessarily excluded in this test. 
> 
>  * Whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area;
> * Whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, *i.e.*, in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;
> * Whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;
> * Whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;
> * Whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;
> * Whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

 Due to the context of anonymous imageboards, the 8kun administration does not tolerate images of real children and Global Volunteers will treat such content as either child pornography or a Dost violation. Such content will be deleted and the IP address that posted it will be banned permanently.

 Especially, nude photography of children (breasts / genitals), even within the context of "legal" nude photography (such as nudist colonies), are not allowed under any circumstances given the context of the website they are being posted on \[please refer to *United States of America v. Michael Arvin* (900 F.2d 1385\)].

 For the purposes of 8kun, given the legal grayness surrounding three\-dimensional (3D) computer\-generated child pornography and the so\-called "real dolls" and how similar they are to real children, 3D renderings that violate the aforementioned Dost test and are so realistic as to be *indistinguishable from real children* are also not allowed.

 Furthermore, 8kun Global Volunteers are not required to research links you post to see if they actually contain child pornography. If you give a Global Volunteer, a Board Owner, or a Board Volunteer any reason to believe that a link contains child pornography or a Dost violation, he or she will delete it without clicking on it. You may not personally agree with this, but as a clearnet website hosted in the United States of America, 8kun is required to comply with the laws in force. Please respect that.
