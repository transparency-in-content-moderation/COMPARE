Picture Guidelines
==================




* 5 months ago
* Updated







On Tellonym, pictures can be added to answers as well as to your profile as avatars. We aim to ensure that publishing pictures is a fun experience for all users while also making sure the content is appropriate for individuals outside of the Tellonym community.


All the rules from our Community Guidelines apply to the pictures you post, as well as the specified rules on this page.


 


**Brief**
=========


Post only your own pictures and do not post pictures of others without their consent.


Respect everyone and do not publish pictures that are unsuitable for a broader audience. Keep in mind that not every content you may deem appropriate is automatically acceptable to a younger audience as well.


We do not condone sexual content, nudity, or sexually suggestive content. This also includes digitally or traditionally created pictures that show such. In general, any content that may serve the purpose of driving sexual messages or promoting sexual services is to be refrained from even if the image content does not depict nudity.


Nudity in paintings or sculptures is tolerated as long as it is not linked to sexual purposes.


Moreover, posting graphic, violent, hate\-driven, or otherwise illegal content is not permitted on Tellonym. Publishing private data of others that is otherwise not accessible to the public is also forbidden. Always post in compliance with the law.


By using our platform, you agree to be committed to these guidelines. Violations can lead to your posts being removed, warnings, account suspensions, or other restrictions.
