Community GuidelinesWelcome to BitChute, a content sharing platform and associated services offered by Deep State Protocol, LLC ("DSP") . BitChute aims to put creators first and provide them with a service that they can use to flourish and express their ideas freely. We aim to provide a forum for civil, productive discourse regarding the conditions, issues, events, and creative works which comprise and affect human flourishing generally.

These Community Guidelines describe the behavior that is expected from you and the rest of the BitChute community. By continuing to use the site, you are agreeing with and accepting these Community Guidelines in their entirety. They should be read and understood in conjunction with **Our Commitment** to the BitChute community.

Respect \& Decency
------------------

All members of the community and wider society should be treated as equals with the same rights, regardless of their race, age, sex, religion, political beliefs, or any other immutable attribute or self\-assigned designation.

We expect members of the BitChute community to act maturely and in a decent manner that is respectful to other members of the community and wider society.

Personal Responsibility
-----------------------

As an individual, you are responsible for your own actions, and you will be held accountable for any content that you add to the BitChute platform, along with any related metadata such as titles, descriptions, thumbnails, hashtags, etc.

You are not responsible for the actions of others on the site; however, you are expected to consider that others may be influenced and/or incited by the content you produce.

Content creators are obligated to ensure that they do not add content which violates the **Prohibited Content** or **Platform Misuse** guidelines, and that any content that they do add has the correct **Content Sensitivity** assigned to it.

All members of the BitChute community have a responsibility to each other to follow these guidelines.

Compliance with Law
-------------------

You own and are legally responsible for all the content you add to the BitChute platform.

We expect members of the BitChute community to comply with their domicile's laws pertaining to online conduct, communication and content. BitChute's **Guidelines Enforcement** process respects applicable laws pertaining to online communications.

Before sharing content on BitChute, please be sure you have the right to do so. We expect you to respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights of third parties. Remember to reference applicable fair use laws, as appropriate, when adding content to the BitChute platform. See our **Copyright Policy** to learn how we handle reports involving alleged copyright infringement.

When requested to do so by competent authorities, we may apply geoblocking filters on specific content that is considered illegal within a particular country. These filters will be applied so that they do not impact viewing of the content in any country where the content is still deemed legal.

Content Sensitivity
-------------------

To help users control the content that they encounter on BitChute, we provide them with tools to adjust the content sensitivity level via their account settings. By default, a user's settings will allow for viewing of only content marked at or below **Normal** sensitivity. Also by default, all content added to BitChute by creators will be marked as **Normal** sensitivity and will be visible to all users. Creators are expected to mark their content as **Not Safe For Work (NSFW)** or **Not Safe For Life (NSFL)**, when appropriate, before making their content public. **Guidelines Enforcement** processes are employed to ensure the appropriate sensitivity level is applied to content. If you encounter inappropriately marked content on BitChute, please flag it using our **Flagging \& Reporting** tools.

**Note:** A creator’s ability to change the sensitivity of a piece of content will be removed if the sensitivity of that content has been set through an enforcement process.

Content sensitivity levels are defined as follows:

### Normal

This is the default sensitivity level for content on the platform. Content should be left as Normal sensitivity only if it does not meet the thresholds to be marked Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or Not Safe For Life (NSFL) described below.

Normal content should provide the viewer with an experience equivalent to that provided by content receiving the **British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) ‘12’ rating**.

### Not Safe For Work (NSFW)

Content that is not safe for viewing in the workplace, or similar environments, must be marked as such by the content creator prior to publishing.

Content containing discriminatory language, drug use, nudity and/or moderate violence should be marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW).

Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content provides a viewing experience equivalent to that of material receiving the **British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) ‘15’ rating**.

### Not Safe For Life (NSFL)

This level of sensitivity goes beyond Not Safe For Work (NSFW). Many if not most people will find this content upsetting, no matter where or when it is viewed.

Material that contains graphic content, which should be viewed with discretion, must be marked as Not Safe For Life (NSFL) by the content creator prior to publishing.

Not Safe For Life (NSFL) is equivalent to the **British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) ‘18’ rating**.

In addition, any material that is produced by, or which endorses, empowers, or otherwise promotes individuals, organizations, or any other entity engaging in the following activities is not permitted.

In addition, those designated by the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States of America, the United Nations, the European Union or any member state of the European Union are prohibited on the platform.

BitChute maintains and publishes a **Prohibited Entities List** of entities that have been independently identified and are explicitly prohibited on the platform under this guideline. As this list will evolve over time, we suggest that all users check it regularly.

### Threats or Incitement to Violence

Content, including in comments or private messages, which threatens violence or is likely to incite violence.

### Exemptions

For material that, on its face, seems to fall under the above categories, we consider the context, intent, and whether it qualifies for an exemption under any of the following:

1. Press Freedom
2. Political Discourse
3. Holding Power to Account
4. Satire, Parody, Humor or Comedy
5. Works of Fiction
6. Religious
7. Historical
8. Educational

For example, if a user were to complain about a BitChute or DSP official in the form of suggesting that our CEO launch said official into space, that would fall under the Satire, Parody, Humor or Comedy exemption.

If the material does not qualify for an exemption (doxxing and child sexual abuse materials are notable examples), then we will take appropriate enforcement action.

Platform Misuse
---------------

Misuse of the platform and/or the functionality provided is not permitted and should, when discovered, be reported using the **Flagging \& Reporting** tools provided. The following are some examples of what we consider to be misuse of the platform:

**Dogpiling or Brigading** \- Coordinated group attacks with the aim to shame, silence, or otherwise shut down other users.

**Metric Manipulation** – Manipulation of metrics such as views, likes, and/or subscriptions. When this is detected such metrics will be adjusted to compensate.

**Misleading Metadata** \- Creating misleading titles, descriptions, tags, or thumbnails in order to increase views or otherwise trick users into viewing your content.

**Name Squatting or Impersonation** – Claiming a username, channel name, or other similar entity on the site with the intention to trade it, exploit its similarity to another, or otherwise trick users into viewing your content. Parody which is not misleading is, of course, permitted.

**Scamming** \- Attempts to scam others out of their earnings, views, votes, or anything else.

**Spamming** \- Posting large amounts of unwanted or repetitive content, including in comments or private messages. Posting the same content more than once or twice may be considered spam, especially when it appears to take commercial advantage of a creator's goodwill or following.

Introduction
------------

The objective of this article is to help explain our Incitement to Hatred prohibition within the **Community Guidelines**, how we identify material that violates it, and what enforcement actions we take to restrict such material.

What is Incitement to Hatred?
-----------------------------

Within the prohibition wording we state this as any material likely to incite hatred against a group of persons or a member of a group of persons based on specific grounds, but what does this cover and how is it applied?

What are the specific grounds?
------------------------------

The regulations, as defined in **Section 368E Subsection (1\) of the UK Communications Act 2003**, specify that the grounds to be considered are those referred to in  **Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union**. To be more precise, the specific grounds identified are as follows:

* Sex
* Race
* Colour
* Ethnic or social origin
* Genetic features
* Language
* Religion or belief
* Political or any other opinion
* Membership of a national minority
* Property
* Birth
* Disability
* Age
* Sexual orientation

What material is covered?
-------------------------

To help identify if material is covered by the prohibition, we look for behaviour that indicates the presence of potential Incitement to Hatred, and then consider this against a set of possible exemptions.

Material that contains one or more of the following indicators targeted at a group of persons or member of a group of persons based on any of the specific grounds above is in\-scope:

* Derogatory, denigrating, or demonising statements
* Suggestions of superiority or inferiority
* Calls for detrimental action
* Used as proof of criminality
* Used as justification for historical crimes

For material that is in\-scope we consider the context, intent and whether it qualifies for an exemption under any of the following:

* Press Freedom
* Political Discourse
* Holding Power to Account
* Satire, Parody, Humour or Comedy
* Works of Fiction
* Religious
* Historical
* Educational

If the material does not qualify for an exemption, then we will take appropriate enforcement action.

What enforcement action is taken?
---------------------------------

When material is confirmed by our moderators as being in violation of the Incitement to Hatred prohibition, it will be restricted to prevent viewing within a specific set of geographical areas, these are:

* United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
* Member states of the European Union
* States that form the European Economic Area
* Territories of any state covered by the above

The owner of the content where the material was found will be notified that their content has been identified as violating the Incitement to Hatred prohibition, and this will also be displayed on the Visibility tab of their content management pages. The content owner will be able to challenge the decision by submitting an appeal with sufficient supporting evidence.
