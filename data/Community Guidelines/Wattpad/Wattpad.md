Exchanging Money
----------------

**User Organized Giveaways and Prizes**

User\-organized giveaways cannot be monetary or physical in nature. Appropriate prizes include Follows, Reads or Digital Gifts. For user organized giveaways, hosts must clearly state that Wattpad has no affiliation with said giveaway and that hosts completely release Wattpad of all liability in connection with the giveaway.

Wattpad strongly recommends against sharing personal information with other users.

**Wattpad Affiliated Contests**

Wattpad regularly organizes contests like The Wattys and other contests where prizes can be monetary or physical in nature. For more information on these contests, please visit this page. People affiliated with Wattpad also organize contests and giveaways.

These contests are distinguishable from other contests because they will always be on official accounts which have a Badge identifying their association with Wattpad. Read the article on Badges here.

**Accepting Payment**

Wattpad works with some creators to add paywalls around their content. No one can demand or require payment for content or services on Wattpad other than through official tools which Wattpad provides.

Users are allowed to link to third\-party sites where they can accept money, but payment cannot be mandatory for others to pay to access content or services.
