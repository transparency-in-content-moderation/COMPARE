Blind is where you can have candid discussions on professional and personal matters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our mission of transparency breaks down professional barriers \- creating informed decisions, public feedback, and outcome\-driven conversations.

Blind expects the community to respect our rules, each other, and the employee\-employer compact. We understand that to foster a diverse, truthful, and transparent space, we must be able to express ourselves freely â€” regardless of where we work, what we do, or how much money we make.

Blind is a self\-moderating community. However, our community team may take action if people disrespect each other, act in a non\-professional manner, provoke others, practice toxic behavior, or engage in bad faith. This is applicable to all Blind users, including moderators.

Blind is for real people, real conversations, and real change. To ensure our impact is good and never harmful, and to create a space where everyone can openly share their thoughts \-\- weâ€™d like to share our community guidelines:

### Be Yourself. Be Supportive. Be Responsible.

### If you see something. Say something. ðŸ‘€

Our community depends on quality, authentic, and responsible membership.

If you see a discussion thread, post, or comment that may violate these community guidelines, please flag it for review. If you see another member abusing you or others, take action: Block them or flag the conversation for review. We use these signals, in addition to our content algorithms, to keep Blind a safe space for real conversations about work.

If you have additional questions, please visit ourÂ FAQs.

### Rules violations may result in action against your account. ðŸ™…

Our community guidelines help establish norms and positive behavior, and create a safe space for authentic and open conversation.

We may take action as a result of negative community activity, rule\-violating content, or in response to community feedback or analysis. Actions vary depending on the severity, perceived impact, and frequency of behavior. Repeated incidents and reports may result in disciplinary action(s) or termination of your account.

If you have additional questions, please visit ourÂ FAQs.
