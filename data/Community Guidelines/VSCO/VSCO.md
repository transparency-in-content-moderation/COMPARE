Community GuidelinesEffective as of September 30, 2023

###### The Overview

At VSCO, we believe in an authentic and trusting community that is and always will be Creator\-first. We want to create and maintain a safe space for creators to experiment freely, be inspired, and make meaningful connections. These Community Guidelines are intended to help us do just that, to ensure our community remains positive, supportive, and trusted. Thank you for doing your part in building our community.

###### The Detail

These Community Guidelines, along with our **Terms of Use**, explain what is and isn’t allowed on VSCO. They apply to all content, including all forms of communication (such as text, messaging, images, videos, audio, links, and emojis), and to everyone on our platform (who we refer to as “Creators”). While we aim to provide specific guidance on what is prohibited on VSCO, these rules do not capture all possible instances of abuse on our platform. We reserve the right to decide, in our sole discretion, what content violates these guidelines and will not be permitted on VSCO. Keep in mind that this is a living, breathing document that VSCO may periodically review, refine, and revise.

When content or any individual violates these guidelines or our **Terms of Use**, we may take a number of enforcement steps including issuing warnings, removing content, suspending or removing the accounts, and potentially reporting them to law enforcement. Visit our Safety Center for more information on safety and enforcement at VSCO.
