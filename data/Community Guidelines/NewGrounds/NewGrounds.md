Our content submission and review process varies per content type. Some rules are common among all content types:

  


* You must be the owner and creator of the work you are submitting.

  


* Your work may not be racist, homophobic, hateful or illegal.

  


* Your work may not blatantly come from a tutorial.

  


* If your submission is adult in nature, it must be your own original artwork and not involve photo or video nudity.

  


* Your work may not depict sexually suggestive situations with children (this judgement is based on the imagery alone, regardless of whether you say the subject is 18\+ in the comments). Lolicon and cub art fall under this category. If you try to flirt with the boundaries of this rule, be aware that at any point we may delete your account without notice and we will not debate it with you.

  


* If you are directly making light of / exploiting a tragedy, we may or may not choose to stand by your freedom of expression. You may have to take it somewhere else. We've defended most stuff in the past but nothing is absolute.

  


Please see the specific rules for:

  


* Audio
* Games
* Movies
* Art
* Blog Posts

  


If you are wondering how to create any of the content available on the site, see our Creator Resources section.

  


Unfinished works are best posted on Dumping Grounds. We have a variety of forums where you may share your link and solicit feedback!

  


All submissions to the site currently fall into one of four categories: Games, Movies, Art, or Audio. While we don't officially accept Literature as a submission type, there is an active writing community in the Writing Forum where you can submit your work.

❌ Do not upload AI\-generated audio!
------------------------------------

❌ Do not upload audio you did not make yourself!
------------------------------------------------

  


In addition to the rules outlined in our Terms of Use, the following rules apply to the Audio Portal:

  


Прочтите эти правила на русском языке. (these rules in Russian)

  


**Do not upload music you did not make because you want to use it in Geometry Dash.**

  


In order for a song to be used in Geometry Dash, it must be added to an official whitelist by RobTop. This means any stolen music you upload to Newgrounds will NEVER appear in Geometry Dash and your account will be banned when you get caught trying.

  


**Do not upload audio that you did not create and have full rights to.**

  


Newgrounds is a place to share your own original works, not to post your favorite song from the radio or a song your friend asked you to upload. If you didn't make it, DO NOT upload it.

  


Collaborations are allowed but it is strongly advised that your first submission is not a collaboration. Please do not accept to be part of collaborations which you didn't contribute to.

  


Covers / Remixes
----------------

  


**You may not upload a cover or remix of an unlicensed commercial song.**

  


COVERS and REMIXES of existing songs are accepted if you have permission from the original artist or the original song is public domain. We can not accept covers of songs you've heard on the radio or anything else you don't have rights to. If the song is public domain or you have a license to cover it, *please note these details in your author commentary* to give clarity to the moderators.

  


Mash\-ups of unlicensed commercial music are also not allowed due to similar rights issues.

  


Please ensure that your song is able to pass a “reasonable person test”, meaning that it does not sound similar or have VSTs or Synths that sound similar to copyrighted materials.

  


Nightcore (speeding up source material and increasing pitch) is not allowed even if you have permission to use the source material.

  


Samples / Stock Loops
---------------------

  


**You may not use copyrighted / unlicensed samples.**

  


You aren't allowed to have ANY copyrighted samples in your song. Not even a millisecond. Movie quotes, game sound effects, acapellas of popular singers, etc. have a VERY good chance of being copyrighted.

  


**You may not use stock loops/samples in an unoriginal arrangement.**

  


There are plenty of pre\-made loop packages available. Simply mixing these loops isn't your own original work; you will need to make more effort to create something unique.

  


Music made with Groovepad, Live Loop and similar software falls under the stock loops category.

  


We will be somewhat lenient with stock loop usage if your own original vocals are a big focus of the song, however we ask that you please clearly source where your loops are from and confirm you have full rights to use them. Also be sure to credit your vocals, even when it's you!

  


AI Music
--------

  


**Please do not share AI (made by machine learning algorithm) music here.**

  


If your song was generated via AI, we do not consider this your own original work and you should not share it here. Subtle use of AI is acceptable, for example if you are using AI\-generated components as part of a larger original composition.

  


MIDI
----

  


**You may not upload a MIDI\-rip or 1:1 recreation with new instruments.**

  


Downloading a Zelda MIDI and assigning different instruments from the original is NOT your own work.

  


Similarly, if you remake a song by ear but the composition is 100% identical and only the instruments have changed, this also does not count as your own work. Your version must be original enough to not be recognized as a reskin.

  


Music Maker Restrictions
------------------------

  


**You may not upload music made with Magix Music Maker Jam, Soundation, you.dj, Ampify or BandLab (the mobile app, not Cakewalk).**

  


Besides falling under the Stock Loops rule, Magix Music Maker Jam automatically puts all songs you create with it under its own license \- uploading the song to Newgrounds is in violation of that license.

  


Soundation and you.dj have similar issues where you do not retain full rights to the music you create using these services.

  


Other Rules and Notes
---------------------

  


**Your audio should not contain sexual themes involving underage characters.**

  


Examples of this include audio that may be described as ageplay, loli or shota. Adult\-themed audio is fine but we don't want anything that would appeal to or attract pedophiles.

  


**Your audio can not damage ears or be painful to listen to.**

  


White noise, blowing into the microphone, screaming, text\-to\-speech, etc. doesn't belong in the Audio Portal.

  


**Your may not remove and re\-submit the same audio for personal gain.**

  


This includes instances of trying to get a better score or trying to get another round of publicity. Once you have submitted audio, you can update the existing entry but you should not remove it purely for the sake of re\-uploading it.

  


**You should cite your resources.**

  


VST's, samples, software, hardware, sound effects... these are all things you should mention in your Author's Comments, especially if it's your first submission. Posting "nice song" as Author's Comments and then submitting an amazing 5\-minute song doesn't look very legitimate.

  


**Credit your vocalist!**

  


If there are vocals in your song, please credit your vocalist. If you are using vocals from a pack or from on\-line, it's helpful to note the source and confirm you have rights to use the vocals.

  


If you have any queries on whether something is acceptable or not, ask an audio moderator.

Newgrounds Wiki: Game Guidelines
--------------------------------





Page Contents
-------------

* Rights and Ownership
* Adult Themes
* Hate Speech
* Other Things to Avoid



In addition to the rules outlined in our Terms of Use:

  


Rights and Ownership
--------------------

  


You must be the creator and owner of the game you are submitting.

  


You must have rights to the music in your game, or be using music that grants rights freely. Your favorite song from the radio can't be played here.

  


Your game must not be a modified version of someone else's work, including tutorial files.

  


Your game must not use Angry Birds or Super Mario Bros. characters/sprites. In general you shouldn't be using any sprites you don't have full rights to.

  


Do not include copyrighted video clips or photographs that you did not create.

  


Adult Themes
------------

  


You may not include photography or video of naked people.

  


You may not include photography or video images of excessive gore and/or "snuff."

  


Do not include illegal photography or video such as child pornography and bestiality. We WILL contact the FBI!

  


Sexual content involving underage characters is prohibited, please don't look for grey areas. Adding a disclaimer that all characters are 18\+ or Over 18 does not get your submission around the No Grey Areas clause.

  


Make sure your game has been properly rated. Any nudity beyond a non\-sexualized butt should fall under the A rating nowadays.

  


Hate Speech
-----------

  


Your game must not be racist or downright hateful towards specific groups of people.

  


Personal attacks towards other NG contributors will likely result in removal.

  


Other Things to Avoid
---------------------

  


Your submission must not auto\-redirect to a new site or open pop\-ups. If your submission auto\-spawns something to boost stats on another site, your account will be deleted and admins for the target site will be notified.

  


Your game must work on Newgrounds, in a web browser. If you ask users to download and install something to play your game, it will be removed. The only exception here is traditional Flash games that require NG Player to run, assuming they don't work via Ruffle emulation.

  


It would be best if your game does not rely on any calls to third party servers. If you are using a third party API or anything that could be used to track a user, you must give notice of this at the start of your game and give the user the option to opt out. If the user opts out, you may not give the third party any access to their session.

  


Your game must not be shovelware made to serve ads or promote your site. If you didn't take personal pride and care in the creation of the content, leave it off NG.

  


You may not upload games made in Kogama (previously Adventure Box).

  


Your game must not be a pointless "demo" or "preview" without any redeeming qualities.

  


Do not re\-submit your entry after it has been BLAMMED without making noticeable improvements.

 









Newgrounds Wiki: Movie Guidelines
---------------------------------





Page Contents
-------------

* Rights and Ownership
* Adult Themes
* Hate Speech
* AI Animation
* Other Things to Avoid



In addition to the rules outlined in our Terms of Use:

  


Our focus is on animation. If you want to try live action here, it must be a short film with legit production value and an animation component done in post production.

  


Rights and Ownership
--------------------

  


You must be the creator and owner of the content you are submitting.

  


You must credit and have rights to the music in your submission, or be using music that grants rights freely. Your favorite song from the radio can't be performed here. Here are some music resources.

  


Your submission must not be a modified version of someone else's work, including tutorial files.

  


Do not submit copyrighted video clips or photographs you did not create.

  


You may parody existing movie submissions but you must create your own artwork.

  


Tools such as GMod or 3D Movie Maker along with third party assets have generally been allowed, however one of our goals is to avoid shovelware, so low\-effort entries made with third party assets may be removed. GoAnimate is not accepted a majority of the time. We want people to share meaningful (even if silly or stupid) work, vs bulk uploads for promotional or spamming purposes.

  


Adult Themes
------------

  


You may not submit photography or video of naked people.

  


You may not submit photography/video images of excessive gore and/or "snuff."

  


Do not submit illegal photography/video such as child pornography and bestiality. We WILL report you to authorities.

  


Sexual content involving underage characters is prohibited, please don't look for grey areas. Adding a disclaimer that all characters are 18\+ or Over 18 does not get your submission around the No Grey Areas clause.

  


Make sure your submission has been properly rated.

  


If your animation is fetish content, please just mark at as adult; people get unhappy when fetish content appears in the non\-adult listings.

  


Hate Speech
-----------

  


Your submission must not be racist or downright hateful towards specific groups of people.

  


Personal attacks towards other members of the community and targeted harassment campaigns will likely result in removal.

  


AI Animation
------------

  


This will be an evolving area. If you are an artist who is using AI to assist you in your process, this is most likely fine. We will be removing things like AI slideshows, however. For example if you take an audio track and play it alongside static images generated by AI, that will likely be removed.

  


Our enforcement will be largely subjective as we get a handle on what cases are valid uses of AI and what cases are over\-dependent on a computer doing the bulk of creative work.

  


Other Things to Avoid
---------------------

  


Your submission must not simply be an advertisement. This includes short "low substance" videos intended to direct people to your Patreon. It's ok to promote a Patreon but your upload shouldn't feel like a gimmick to simply siphon viewers.

  


Your submission must not be a pointless "demo" or "preview" without any redeeming qualities.

  


Do not submit something that is merely a sound visualizer set to music, or a recording of your music project timeline. If you want to promote your song in the movie portal, it should be set to original animation like a proper music video; otherwise stick to the Audio Portal. Our goal here is to not have the Movie Portal be treated as a second Audio Portal. You *might* get a pass on a custom\-made visualizer if it feels like it had real work put into it (vs running your song through a stock visualizer) but if you start uploading multiple songs the same way, they will be treated as shovelware; items being made in bulk with a template.

  


Do not submit Let's Play videos or anything that primarily depends on recorded video game footage.

  


Do not submit pictures in a slideshow format.

  


Do not submit speedpaint / art timelapse videos. We would like to accommodate these in the future but for now your best option would be to embed a YouTube video under your finished art entry in the Art Portal.

  


Do not swap out your original entry with something totally different.

  


Do not re\-submit your entry after it has been BLAMMED without making noticeable improvements.

  


If you are uploading something that could be considered a variant or re\-upload of an existing project, please check the "Opt out of any awards" box at the bottom of your project details form. Variants include style variations of something you previously published, dubs in different languages or a re\-upload of something you previously unpublished. If you are merely updating an existing entry, we ask that you update the existing file rather than create a new entry.

  


Comic Dubs: This is an evolving area. If you are simply adding audio over static images from an existing comic, please refrain from sharing it here. If you have created a motion comic that introduces elements of animation along with audio, you can share it here but only if the artist themselves has an NG account and is co\-authored on the piece. Please rate your entry appropriately; this category has been under much scrutiny after several mis\-rated Adult comic dubs won daily awards. Rate your entry Adult if it contains nudity and sexual situations.

 









Newgrounds Wiki: Art Guidelines
-------------------------------








In addition to the rules outlined in our Terms of Use:

  


**Ownership**

  


You must be the artist and creator of the work you are submitting.

  


If you commissioned a piece and have full publishing rights, we still ask that you have the artist share it under their own account. Newgrounds is all about artists sharing their art in that way. We will be bringing multi\-authoring to the Art Portal, at which point commissioners will be able to be credited alongside the pieces they commissioned. We've made some exceptions here in the past because multi\-authoring wasn't available but have since decided it's best to stick to our original rules.

  


**AI Art**

  


AI\-generated art is not allowed in the Art Portal. This includes using tools such as Midjourney, Dall\-E, and CrAIyon, in addition fractal generators and websites like ArtBreeder, where the user selects two images and they are combined into a new image via machine learning.

  


There are cases where some use of AI is ok, for example if you are primarily showcasing your character art but use an AI\-generated background. In these cases, please note any elements where AI was used so that it is clear to users and moderators.

  


Tracing and coloring over AI\-generated art is something best shared on your blog, as it is much like tracing over someone else's art.

  


Making art from scratch that is inspired by an AI piece is ok. Here are two good examples: Maiden of Flames and Hermin. Both pieces reference the AI art they are based on while being original pieces in their own right.

  


Bottom line: We want to keep the focus on art made by people and not have the Art Portal flooded with computer\-generated art.

  


**Photography**

  


Photography is not allowed in either public or private galleries. We prefer to keep the spotlight on hand\-made works. Photographs of sculptures, paintings or other hand\-made items are acceptable; here's a guide for photographing your art. Filtered photographs are not acceptable. While we respect tracing as a teaching tool when source images are fully reported, please use places like your blog to share traced images, rather than the Art Portal.

  


You may submit collages with photographic elements, providing they constitute a new work of art with handmade elements. If possible, please post links to any photographs, or elements of the collage that were not made by you, to help us determine if the submission is suitably transformative.

  


**Scene Creators, Third Party Assets**

  


Do not submit images made from other people's assets or from scene creator programs.

  


This includes art made with Source Filmmaker; if you did not create the character models, please do not share your piece in the Art Portal. If you are creating your own models and your work is removed, PM Tom. Also be careful not to produce the art equivalent of shovelware, by uploading large numbers of similar entries to the Art Portal. Activity such as this lead to a growing community backlash against SFM.

  


Any 3D assets not modeled by the uploader should not be primary elements of your piece and should be credited and linked to when possible, to help us determine if the submission is suitably original / transformative. In general Daz3D entries aren't allowed because they are largely composed of pre\-existing assets. This is another situation where we became less lenient over time due to the ability of people to flood the Art Portal with renders.

  


UnrealEngine's MetaHuman would similarly be treated as third\-party assets, since the software is creating the model.

  


There are numerous scene and character creator tools beyond the ones listed above. Any software where you arrange pre\-made assets is not accepted in the Art Portal. Examples include Koikatsu Party and Gacha Life.

  


Similarly, please do not submit images where you have added captions or stories over someone else's artwork.

  


Typography is allowed, as is text in comics or story pieces but please avoid pieces that only consist of unmodified text.

  


**Advertisements**

  


Teaser images for live\-streams, content off\-site (such a Patreon perks) and storefront items (such as Etsy plush for sale) can be submitted, however please uncheck the “Finished Piece?” box so that it only shows on your personal gallery and in the feeds of your followers. If it appears you are spamming the Art Portal purely to promote links and not to share completed pieces of art, your entries may be removed as ad spam.

  


**Multiple Image Variants**

  


If you have multiple versions of the same art with subtle differences, such as different background colors, it is preferred that you either post the variants in the commentary under the original piece, or not mark the variants as Finished Pieces so they don't all show up in the main Art Portal listing, crowding out other artists.

  


**Age Guidelines**

  


Please don't create and share adult art here if you are under 18; it's awkward.

  


Your art may not depict a sexually suggestive image of a child. This judgement is based on the image alone, regardless of whether you say the subject is 18\+ in the comments. Lolicon, shotacon and cub art fall under this category. If you appreciate NG's space for adult art, please don't test our boundaries here. At the least, you'll be de\-scouted for testing the line, if not banned or deleted.

  


Creepy territory includes art of characters who are known for being kids, even if you've aged them up. Creepy territory also includes creating lewds of an OC / persona that was created by a minor, even if that character is an adult. Ask yourself how creepy you are being with the art you are creating and if it's creepy behavior, expect it to potentially be removed.

  


Art that implies sexual situations with a minor is not allowed. This may extend to image sets, where some seemingly acceptable images may be removed if they are part of a larger image set that involves sexual situations with a minor.

  


**Content Ratings**

  


Here is an overview of how ratings should be applied:

  


E \- Nothing intended to arouse, no violence, no bad language, no adult themes including alcohol, tobacco, drugs or fetishes.

  


T \- Fully\-clothed, lightly sexy pin\-up, mild cartoon violence, mild explicit language, mild mature themes, no fetishes.

  


M \- Sexualized characters, violence, explicit language, fetishes, mature themes.

  


A \- Nudity, sex, skintight or see\-through outfits that leave nothing to the imagination, extreme gore, fetishes, extreme adult themes.

  


Please make your best effort to rate your art appropriately. Mild artistic nudity (non\-sexualized butts, mostly) is allowed in M\-rated submissions but we ask that nudity not be shown in a thumbnail unless a submission is A\-rated. Any nudity with sexual undertones should go ahead with an A rating. Anything that gives the impression of nudity, like a skintight outfit that retains all of the shapes of what is underneath, is a safe bet for an A rating.

  


If you have made porn but blurred out the naughty bits, please still rate it A as we don't want a bunch of censored porn in the E\-M ratings.

  


Note: Our standards for what is considered Adult have been expanding, to both better meet the expectations of viewers and to stay in line with growing regulations. If you are uncertain about how to rate your art, it is preferred to rate it on the higher side.

  


Having your content ratings adjusted by a moderator is not a punishment but please try to correctly rate your art. Artists who regularly post adult art without an A rating may find themselves de\-scouted for the sake of making the site safer to browse.

  


Anything that could be considered pin\-up art should at least be rated T, though gratuitously endowed or oversexualized pin\-ups belong in M or A.

  


If your work involves a fetish, please include the "fetish" tag along with a tag for the specific fetish, so people can filter accordingly. If your work involves gore, please include the "gore" tag.

  


**Multi\-Image Content Ratings**

  


Your project has a project\-level content rating and the option to set the content rating on individual pieces of art. Currently, our hubs and search features will only refer to the project rating, so you will want to rate your project based on the intended audience. Here are some example scenarios:

  


Example 1: You have uploaded a comic with ten panels. Eight of these panels are rated T but two of them are rated A. Because the A\-rated content is necessary to the story, you should rate your project A.

  


Example 2: You have uploaded a series of variants of your OC in different outfits. Most of these variants are rated E but you have one that is rated A. You could choose to rate your project E and people will find it while browsing E, or you could rate it A and people will find it while browsing A. If someone browsing E views your project, the A\-rated portion will be filtered if they don’t have A\-rated content enabled. In the future it’s possible your project could show up in both E and A results but that will require a larger re\-architecture on our end.

  


**Hate / Bullying**

  


Your art may not promote hate towards a race or sexuality, or celebrate / fetishize hate groups. If your portrait of a "sexy nazi" is removed, this is why. Also please avoid the use of slurs. You might think, "I can use the n\-word because I'm black" but anonymous people will use that excuse to try and get away with stuff so our rule is that if it appears derogatory, we're gonna treat it as derogatory.

  


You may not use art to bully another user.

  


Lewds based on actual people may be treated as harassment and removed.

  


**More About the Art Portal**

  


If you are looking for more information about the Art Portal and how it works, please see the Art wiki page.

 









Newgrounds Wiki: Blog Guidelines
--------------------------------








In addition to the rules outlined in our Terms of Use:

  


Image uploading in blogs has more loose rules than the Art Portal, however you still may not upload images that present ownership / rights concerns. Examples include posting stock photography or posting art by other artists who have not explicitly made their art free to share and repost. If you are posting art by another artist, please credit the artist and offer a citation of where they have stated their art free to share and repost in this manner.

  


Photography is allowed on blogs but not photography of naked people or people performing sexual acts.

  


Your post may not depict a sexually suggestive image of a child (note: this judgement is based on the image alone, regardless of whether you say the subject is 18\+). Lolicon and cub art fall under this category. If you appreciate NG's space for adult art, please don't test our boundaries here.

  


Please don't share adult material on your blog if you are under 18; it's awkward.

  


You may not promote hate towards a race or sexuality, or celebrate / fetishize hate groups. Please avoid the use of slurs. You might think, "I can use the n\-word because I'm black" but anonymous people will use that excuse to try and get away with stuff, so our rule is that if it appears derogatory, we're gonna treat it as derogatory.

  


Do not use your blog to bully or harass other users.

  


Please make your best effort to rate your post appropriately. If you have nudity in your post, or your post is primarily to promote and link to adult content, it is best to rate it A.

  


Don't abuse the @ feature to spam people.

  


Please do not make suicide announcement posts. If you are having thoughts of suicide, please dial 988 in the US or try this list of International Suicide Hotlines.
