Community Guidelines  
 NeighborsAgencies
=========================================

We’re glad you’re here.
-----------------------


We want everyone to feel welcome on Nextdoor, and we have created these Guidelines to define the values of the community we want to build. On Nextdoor, you’re connected not by a shared preference, but a shared connection to a place — your neighborhood. Let’s build a strong one together.



1\. Be respectful to your neighbors
-----------------------------------


You’re speaking to your real neighbors. Strong communities are built on strong relationships.


2\. Do not discriminate
-----------------------


We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any kind.


3\. Discuss important topics in the right place
-----------------------------------------------


We have policies and dedicated spaces for important non\-local topics, such as national politics.  
 


4\. Use your true identity
--------------------------


Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re communicating with their real neighbor, and therefore require you to use your true identity.   
 


5\. Do not engage in harmful activity
-------------------------------------


We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm to scams.  
 


You, our neighbors who make up Nextdoor, play a key role in neighborhood moderation by reporting content or neighbors that violate these Guidelines. Please remember that disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it. This slows down our ability to remove content that is truly abusive and to create a platform where everyone feels welcome.

Be respectful to your neighbors  
 Neighbors
============================================


The Community Guidelines describe behaviors that are and are not allowed on Nextdoor. Violations of these guidelines may result in removal of content or loss access to Nextdoor. 



  
You’re speaking to your real neighbors. Strong communities are built on strong relationships. 
1. Civil conversations
2. Public shaming


Civil conversations
-------------------




---


We encourage neighbors to have conversations about the issues that matter to them in a way that is constructive, civil, and builds community. You can, of course, think what you like, but on Nextdoor, conversations must remain civil. This is not always easy because we care passionately about the places we call home – our neighborhoods. If you are angry about something a neighbor has said or done, take a deep breath, count to ten, and then come back to post something thoughtful and constructive.  
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Attacking, berating, bullying, belittling, insulting, harassing, threatening, trolling, or swearing at others or their views even if you really disagree with them. This includes communication within a group or via direct message. |  |
| Stating your view, opinion, or disagreeing with someone in a civil and respectful manner. |  |
| Posting about your concerns with community moderation in the main newsfeed. For example, about why your content was reported, or removed |  |
| Using direct messages to resolve personal disputes, or better yet, getting together in person to resolve the matter amicably. |  |
| Continuing to contact a neighbor after they've requested that you stop. |  |


 


Tips for civil conversations
----------------------------




---


Every neighbor should feel welcome, safe, and respected when using Nextdoor.  
  
Disagreements aren’t easy, but we can learn a lot from them. We encourage neighbors to approach multi\-perspective discussions with compassion and empathy. 


**Follow these guidelines for disagreeing respectfully:**


* **Be mindful of how you participate.** Ask yourself before you engage if your words will effect change, understanding, and empathy in your community.
* **Respectfully challenge the idea, not the person.** Focus on the facts or ideas you want to communicate, without attacking the person.
* **Don’t make assumptions.** When you’re unsure about something someone has said, ask for clarification and be willing to listen to the response.
* **Avoid generalizing or over\-simplifying.** Being too general may overshadow the heart of the matter and appear as insensitive.
* **Acknowledge common ground.** Even if you don’t wholeheartedly agree with someone, if you can appreciate something they’ve said or done, let them know.
* **Encourage understanding.** If you are part of a discussion on Nextdoor that has become harmful or offensive, do your part to encourage empathy and understanding.
* **Identify clear actions your community can follow.** Work toward solutions that acknowledge and address the needs and concerns of everyone in your neighborhood.
* **Cite Sources.** If you are sharing data, please include your source for clarity and to help support the discussion with facts.


  
Our Community Guidelines are intended to ensure that every neighbor feels welcome, safe, and respected when using Nextdoor. If you see posts or comments that violate these guidelines, please report it so that we may remove it. Keep in mind that disagreeing with a post is not a reason to report it. This slows down our ability to remove content that is truly abusive and to create a platform that can help build stronger communities.


Public shaming
--------------




---


Public shaming has no place on Nextdoor. Whether it's directly or indirectly targeting a neighbor, a public figure, or the victim of a crime, shaming others is harmful and uncivil.  
 


**IMPORTANT** If you are concerned about a house, vehicle, or individual engaging in illegal activity, you should call 911 or your local health and human services agency. Before posting, consider how your post might be received by the people you are posting about, who may also be neighbors of Nextdoor

* If the people involved request that the post be removed, we may remove it.
* If a parent or guardian requests that a photo of a minor be removed from Nextdoor, we may remove it.



 



|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Posting about a safety concern in your neighborhood when you do not know the person involved or how to contact them. Remember to do so in a civil and respectful way. |  |
| Writing disparagingly about the victim of a crime or insinuating victim culpability. |  |
| Writing a negative review of a service provider after a bad commercial interaction as long as the post is civil and describes the person's experience. |  |
| Writing a review of a service provider that contains personal attacks, public shaming, libel or name calling. |  |
| Geo\-tagging a neighbor’s home location without their knowledge or permission for the purposes of humiliation, shaming, or complaining. |  |


 



Policies to prevent racism \& discrimination  
 Neighbors
=========================================================


The Community Guidelines describe behaviors that are and are not allowed on Nextdoor. Violations of these guidelines may result in removal of content or loss of access to Nextdoor. 



  
We do not tolerate racism, hateful language, or discrimination of any kind on Nextdoor. Please review our specific policies:


1. No racism, discrimination, or hate speech
2. Support for equality
3. Our commitment to our neighbors


 

To learn best practices for discussing issues related to race and discrimination on the Nextdoor app or website, please review the following resources:
* Real examples for discussing racial equality in a positive manner
* Nextdoor’s recommended resources for understanding racial bias



No racism, discrimination, or hate speech
-----------------------------------------


People on Nextdoor are your real neighbors, and ALL should feel that they belong. Racism and racial discrimination create an environment of exclusion, intimidation, and fear. No one should feel this way in any neighborhood, but it is particularly harmful if it is the neighborhood in which you live.   
  
We have a strict policy against racist behavior, discrimination, and hate speech of any kind in Nextdoor posts and conversations. While we recently launched an anti\-racism notification aimed at preventing discriminatory language on Nextdoor, it’s still important for neighbors to consider how their words might impact others. **Before posting something that could be interpreted as racist or discriminatory, ask yourself:**


 

1. How would you feel if someone directed this statement at your child, parent, or significant other?
2. Is this a statement or point of view that you would share at work, in your place of worship, or in a city meeting?
3. Would you state your comment in person to the individual or group of people you are referring to?


  
*Please pause to deeply consider how your words may affect your neighbor.* Learn more about preventing racial profiling.   
  
If you see a Nextdoor post or comment that you believe is discriminatory or racist in nature, please follow these steps to report it. If you see a racist post or comment from a neighbor whose behavior is repeatedly or egregiously discriminatory or racist, please follow these steps to report the individual.  
  
We are committed to removing any content (posts, comments, profile photos) or racist behavior that violate this policy. Furthermore, neighbors repeatedly engaging in this behavior will be subject to temporary or permanent removal from Nextdoor. This behavior includes, but is not limited to:


 



| **Racism, discrimination, or insults** | |
| --- | --- |
| Discriminating against, threatening, or insulting others (including public figures) based on their membership in a protected or marginalized group. Protected and marginalized groups include: People grouped together based on their actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, age, immigration status, national origin, religion or faith, sex or gender identity, sexual orientation, housing or socio\-economic status, disability or medical condition, weight or size, and veteran status. |  |
| Assuming that someone is engaged in suspicious activity or criminal behavior because of their race or ethnicity. (Learn more about preventing racial profiling.) |  |
| Using negative stereotypes, caricatures, or generalizations about a group of individuals. This includes the use of insulting imagery or memes. |  |
| Using slurs, profanity, derogatory racial terms, or other language that reduces an individual’s humanity. This includes the use of the dehumanizing terms, “illegals,” “illegal aliens,” or “aliens” to refer to non\-citizens, the use of racial code words (e.g., “Thug” or “Oriental”), as well as the use of derogatory language to refer to people who have a criminal history (e.g., "scum" or "animals"). |  |
| Denying an individual’s gender identity or sexual orientation, or promoting support for conversion therapy and related programs. |  |
| Mocking or attacking the beliefs, sacred symbols, movements, or institutions of marginalized or protected groups |  |
| **Hate speech, violence, or threats** | |
| Showing or eliciting support for hate groups or people promoting hateful activities. |  |
| Promoting hate\-based conspiracy theories and misinformation (e.g., Holocaust denial or “Antifa is invading the suburbs”) |  |
| Suggesting, showing, threatening, or glorifying the use of violence — even jokingly — against an individual or a group of individuals. |  |
| Attempting to condone or trivialize violence against others — even inadvertently (e.g., “Yeah, but that person is a criminal”). |  |


  
 


Support for equality
--------------------


### **Racial equality**


Racism has no place at Nextdoor. We stand in solidarity with neighbors advocating for racial justice and those speaking out against hate. These issues are relevant in neighborhoods everywhere \-\- that’s why we allow conversations in support of Black Lives Matter, Stop Asian Hate, and other movements that advocate for racial equality and civil rights anywhere on Nextdoor as long as they adhere to our community guidelines.   
  
Content posted in opposition or as a rebuttal to support for racial equality is counterproductive and harmful. We ask that neighbors be mindful of engaging constructively in discussions on these issues. While neighbors are free to disagree in civil ways about the policies or tactics advocated by equality movement organizers and supporters, posts and comments intended to undermine their core messages of equality are prohibited. For these reasons:


* Content promoting “All Lives Matter” is prohibited when it’s used to diminish racial equality, the Black Lives Matter movement, or Stop Asian Hate.
* Content promoting “Blue Lives Matter” is prohibited when it’s used to diminish racial equality or the Black Lives Matter movement, but permitted when used to honor, celebrate, or thank the police for work done in a community.
* Content promoting “White Lives Matter” is prohibited, as it is most commonly associated with white supremacist groups.  See our Hate \& Terror Groups policy for more information.


 


To learn best practices for discussing issues related to race and discrimination on the Nextdoor app or website, please review the following resources:
* Real examples for discussing racial equality in a positive manner
* Nextdoor’s recommended resources for understanding racial bias



 


### **LGBTQIA\+ equality**


LGBTQIA\+ stands as an acronym for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and/or Questioning, Intersex, and Asexual community. Homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and any other mistreatment, aggression or unkindness shown to people on the basis of their gender and/or sexual orientation is expressly prohibited on Nextdoor.  LGBTQIA\+ issues have a place in neighborhoods everywhere \-\- that’s why we allow content discussing or celebrating LGBTQIA\+ matters anywhere on Nextdoor as long as it adheres to our community guidelines.  


Our commitment to our neighbors
-------------------------------


Our Community Guidelines were established to ensure all people feel welcome on Nextdoor. We leverage a combination of technology and the human judgment of our neighbors and the Nextdoor Neighborhood Operations team to report and remove content, behavior, and individuals that discriminate or generally make others feel unwelcome.   
  
However, we may not always get this right. Sometimes, this process may fail to remove content that violates our Community Guidelines or it may erroneously remove content that belongs on Nextdoor. If you see either of these situations happening, please report this to us. We are committed to doing what is right and continuously learning, iterating, and improving along the way.   
  
 



Discuss important topics in the right place  
 Neighbors
========================================================


The Community Guidelines describe behaviors that are and are not allowed on Nextdoor. Violations of these guidelines may result in removal of content or restricted access to Nextdoor.



  
Nextdoor is a place for neighbors to connect and discuss topics that matter to their local community. We have dedicated spaces for important non\-local topics, such as politics and religion.  
 


1. Politics
2. Religion
3. Fundraising


Politics
--------


Real\-world impact often begins in a local community, and Nextdoor is the place where neighbors can discuss these topics in a kind and respectful way. In order to keep conversations local in the main newsfeed, conversations about non\-local topics without a local or personal connection, like national partisan politics or international geopolitical issues, may only be discussed in Groups.  
  
It's OK for neighbors to discuss national and internationally\-oriented conversations in the main feed if there is a direct local connection, or if the neighbor is sharing a direct personal experience. **These discussions must adhere to all other community guidelines.**


 



|  | **Allowed anywhere on Nextdoor** | **Groups** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sharing local events, or peaceful rallies or protests that you support or plan to attend |  |  |
| Sharing a personal experience of how a societal issue affects or has affected you or your community.   Please see policies on upholding equality here. |  |  |
| Stating why you support a particular local cause and/or why you support a local, state, or district candidate running for office.  Note: Local candidates are allowed to introduce themselves and their candidacy in the main feed. For more information, see Elections FAQ. |  |  |
| Stating steps people in the community can take to become involved in politics or causes, including how to vote or support causes. |  |  |
| Reposting campaign news, such as announcements of endorsements or fundraising milestones. |  |  |
| Sharing information about campaign fundraisers, requests for campaign donations or the sale of campaign paraphernalia. |  |  |
| Sharing non\-local content about national/federal partisan politics, federal legislation or agency work, or international geopolitical issues. |  |  |


 


**QUICK TIP**  
When sharing a link with your neighbors about a topic, don’t just post the link without a comment. Share with your neighbors what they’ll find if they click through, and why you think it’s relevant to your community and the discussion.
  
  
**Groups provide a dedicated space for those who are interested in using Nextdoor for campaign organizing or for discussing national politics or issues with their neighbors. Of course, local and state politics may have dedicated Groups as well.**  
  
If you don’t see an existing group on a topic you’re interested in, you can start one. Conversations within Groups still need to be respectful and civil and comply with our Community Guidelines.

Religion
--------




---


We know that religion is an important part of many people’s lives that they wish to share with like\-minded neighbors. We also recognize that some people do not appreciate hearing about their neighbor’s religious beliefs. To accommodate both groups, we require that discussions about religion take place in neighbor created groups.  
 


Fundraising
-----------




---


Fundraising posts should be limited to causes that are explicitly relevant to your neighborhood. Do not use Nextdoor to promote fundraisers for non\-local causes or for people outside of the neighborhood. Personal fundraising is not permitted.  
  
See the chart below for guidance on the types of fundraisers that are and are not allowed. 




|  | **Allowed anywhere on Nextdoor** | **Groups** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| School fundraisers |  |  |
| Scouts organizations |  |  |
| Local pet rescue |  |  |
| Local arts organizations |  |  |
| Local fundraising events |  |  |
| Local food banks, charity walk/run, etc. |  |  |
| Local disaster relief or emergency assistance for your neighbors |  |  |
| Kids' bake sales, lemonade stands, and similar youth efforts |  |  |
| Requesting donations for non\-local causes |  |  |
| Requesting donations for one's own personal expenses or business needs, or for members of one's household |  |  |
| Requesting donations for political candidates |  |  |



Use your true identity  
 Neighbors
===================================


The Community Guidelines describe behaviors that are and are not allowed on Nextdoor. Violations of these guidelines may result in removal of content or loss access to Nextdoor. 



 

Nextdoor is built on trust — we want everyone to know they’re communicating with their real neighbor, and therefore ask you to use your true identity.   
 


1. Real names
2. Real addresses
3. Your profile and photo


Real names
----------




---


Nextdoor's Member Agreement requires that every neighbor use their full, real name when signing up on Nextdoor. By real name, we mean the first name that you use when introducing yourself to neighbors, friends, and colleagues and your legal last name.




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Using the name of your business or organization as your account name. Business and service information should be added to the About Me section of your personal profile or included on your business page. |  |
| Including professional titles or educational degrees in your name. This information can be added to your profile. |  |
| Adding emoji to your name. |  |
| Using a nickname, initials, or shortened version of your name as the first name on your account, as long as it’s the name you are known by in the community and not an attempt to obscure your real first name. E.g. If you are known as Bunny Brown or BJ Brown, it  would be acceptable for you to use either name rather than  Barbara Joe Brown, the name on your birth certificate. You can also include a nickname in quotations after your real first name, for example, Barbara "Bunny" Brown. |  |


 

**NOTE**  
Neighbors can use privacy setting options to abbreviate their real last names. See how here.
Real addresses
--------------




---


Nextdoor aims to provide a safe, online space where neighbors can discuss the types of things they’d share in person. To facilitate this sense of trust, membership in a neighborhood is available only to those that reside in or own a home in the community. We also require that all neighbors verify their address.  
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Registering a personal profile at a business or organizational address. |  |
| Registering a personal profile at an address other than your own. |  |
| Registering a personal profile at the address of a home you rent. |  |
| Registering a personal profile at the address of a home you own. |  |
| Registering at a P.O. Box, or other mailing address. |  |
| Registering at an address in a neighborhood you are considering moving to. |  |
| Registering a personal profile at the address of a second home you own. See our article on joining at a second address. |  |
| Registering a personal profile at the address of rental properties you own. |  |


  
See our article on joining at a second address.  
 


Your profile and photos
-----------------------




---


One of Nextdoor’s goals is to encourage more connections between neighbors in real life. That's why adding photos and completing your profile are so important.  
  
Sharing recent photos and information about yourself on your profile helps strengthen these connections and builds a sense of community. This also helps your neighbors connect you to your presence on Nextdoor when they encounter you on the street, in a park, or at a community meeting.   
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Using an alternative, representative profile photo as long as it is appropriate for a general audience. |  |
| Not using a profile photo. |  |
| Not using a cover photo. |  |
| Not completing your profile, or only adding limited information for privacy reasons. |  |
| Using a profile or cover photo that is inappropriate or intimidating. |  |
| Using a profile or cover photo that you do not have the rights to. |  |
| Using a profile or cover photo that is offensive. |  |
| Using a profile photo that is promotional |  |


 


**QUICK TIP**  
Profile fields are optional. You may post only information that you are comfortable sharing. No one will be removed from Nextdoor for not completing their profile, but it's more neighborly to add as much information to your profile as you feel comfortable sharing! 
  

Do not engage in harmful activity  
 Neighbors
==============================================


The Community Guidelines describe behaviors that are and are not allowed on Nextdoor. Violations of these guidelines may result in removal of content or loss access to Nextdoor. 



 

We prohibit any activity that could hurt someone, from physical harm to scams.


1. Appropriately report suspicious activity
2. No threats to the safety of others
3. No fraud or spam
4. No illegal or regulated goods or services
5. No graphic, violent, sexually explicit, or adult content
6. No violations of privacy
7. Misinformation


 


Appropriately report suspicious activity
----------------------------------------




---


**Describing suspicious activity**  
Keeping the neighborhood safe is important to our neighbors. You should always call 911 first to report a safety concern.  
  
Nextdoor takes a strong stand against racial profiling. We expressly prohibit posts that assume someone is suspicious because of their race or ethnicity, as well as messages with vague descriptions that cast suspicion over an entire race or ethnicity. Such messages are ineffective and harm rather than help communities. You can learn more about the root causes of racial profiling, what Nextdoor is doing to prevent it, and how you can help in our Preventing Racial Profiling Resource Center.  
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Posting about a crime about suspicious activity using specific details, like multiple, distinctive characteristics, and describing clothing from head to toe. This helps keep all of your neighbors safe and avoids casting a wide net of suspicion over innocent people of similar race or ethnicity. Learn why full descriptions are so important. |  |
| Posts that assume someone is suspicious because of their race or ethnicity. |  |
| Posts that give descriptions of individuals that are so vague as to cast suspicion over an entire race or ethnicity. |  |
| Identifying a suspect by race and sex alone (including in the subject line of a post). |  |
| Posting about crime or suspicious activity in a category other than Safety. |  |


 


**Important!** When you see suspicious activity in your neighborhood, please do speak up, but please make sure that what you are reporting is actually suspicious.   
  
Don’t assume someone is suspicious because of their race or ethnicity. This is called racial profiling and it is expressly prohibited on Nextdoor. Ask yourself, “Would I be suspicious of this person’s behavior if I took race or ethnicity out of the equation?" Learn more about how to appropriately communicate about crime. 
 

No threats to the safety of others
----------------------------------




---


If Nextdoor is contacted regarding imminent danger to a person's safety, we may also report that concern to the relevant authorities. However, contacting Nextdoor is not a substitute for reporting your safety issue to the relevant authorities.  
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Threatening someone and/or their pet's safety. |  |
| Posting comments that encourage violence against others. |  |
| Threatening someone’s privacy or security. |  |


  
If you believe that your physical safety or the safety of another person is at risk, please call 911 or contact the relevant local authorities.  
 


No fraud or spam
----------------




---


Fraudulent content, phishing, or content we deem to be spam is not permitted.   
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| **Posting fraudulent content.** Any content that purposefully deceives or misrepresents in order to result in financial or personal gain. This includes but is not limited to incentivized posts or reviews of businesses. |  |
| **Posting spam.**Spam is generally defined as unwanted, unsolicited, and/or repeated actions that negatively affect neighbors and the Nextdoor community. This may include but is not limited to * Sending large amounts of direct messages to users who are not expecting them * Contacting people with unwanted content or requests * Repeatedly posting the same or similar content * Posting unoriginal/templated content with no personalization or original commentary |  |
| **Phishing.** Phishing is an attempt to access another's account or record their personal information by getting them to enter their login or other sensitive information into a fake website. |  |


 

No illegal or regulated goods or services
-----------------------------------------




---


Nextdoor is a family\-friendly platform, open to neighbors ages 13 and over. The safety of all our neighbors, young and young\-at\-heart, is a priority. As a result, we prohibit the purchase, trade, sale or distribution of many items that are commonly known to be age\-restricted or government\-regulated. See our list of prohibited goods and services.


 



|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Selling, soliciting, or offering any illegal goods or services, even if they do not explicitly appear on the prohibited list. |  |


   
​If you believe that neighbors in your neighborhood are selling items or services that are illegal in your community, please contact the relevant local authorities (and ask them to notify Nextdoor if they believe the messages should be removed).
 


No graphic, violent, sexually explicit, or adult content
--------------------------------------------------------




---


Neighbors come to Nextdoor to receive trusted information, give and get help, and build real\-world connections with those nearby. Nextdoor prohibits any content that facilitates, encourages, or coordinates commercial sexual services. Additionally, Nextdoor is not an appropriate place to share content that is graphic, violent, or sexually explicit.  People have different sensitivities when it comes to graphic or explicit content, so please post with caution and report if you feel that you’ve come across content that violates this guideline.   
 




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Posting photos that contain nudity. |  |
| Posting sexually explicit or suggestive content. |  |
| Sending unwelcome direct messages to hit on or express romantic interest in neighbors. |  |
| Posting content that is unnecessarily gruesome, gory, graphic, or violent. |  |


  
See our best practices for direct messages. 


No violations of privacy
------------------------




---


To ensure every neighbor's privacy, do not post or share private information without permission.




|  | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- |
| Posting contact information when recommending someone’s services. However, if you post someone’s personal email addresses, phone number, or physical address and they request that it be removed, we may remove it. |  |
| Sharing content outside of Nextdoor by using the built\-in share button that appears on some types of posts. You may share public agency posts, business pages, deals, and public events. |  |
| Reposting information originally posted on Nextdoor without obtaining the author's permission. This includes reposting or sharing screenshots of content with additional neighborhoods on Nextdoor or outside of Nextdoor. |  |
| Posting the content of direct messages sent through Nextdoor without the permission of the sender. |  |
| Posting non\-public legal documents. |  |
| Posting personal contact or account information, such as email addresses, credit cards, or bank information. |  |
| Posting a person’s legal or medical history, unless there is a compelling public interest served by doing so. |  |
| Posting photos of people in public places. However, if a parent or guardian requests that a photo of a minor be removed from Nextdoor, we may remove it. |  |


  
Our guidelines on public shaming also apply to the posting of information about neighbors. See posting examples for this guideline.  
  
Nextdoor’s Privacy Policy describes our corporate privacy and security practices.  
 


Misinformation
--------------




---


At Nextdoor, we’re committed to the safety of our neighbors and take measures to reduce the spread of misinformation related to critical issues such as elections and health emergencies. If you come across a post that you believe contains false information related to these topics, please report it to Nextdoor using the steps outlined below. 


 

* Elections
* Medical Misinformation
	+ Vaccines, generally
	+ Health emergencies


 

Elections
---------


To elevate and share accurate information about voting in elections, Nextdoor works in collaboration with non\-partisan organizations like Vote.org, local government agencies, and more.  
  
**Nextdoor’s election misinformation policy prohibits the following:**


* False or misleading information that could prevent or discourage people from voting, cause their votes not to be counted, or interfere with the election process.
* Messages that call for or could incite interference with the vote counting process.
* False or misleading claims about the results of an election that could lead to interference with the election process.
* Messages that call for or could incite violence to prevent a peaceful transfer of power or orderly succession.


  
**We will also remove known disinformation about candidates if it falls under the following categories:**
* Doctored or fake tweets, quotes, images, or other material about a candidate that is designed to make that candidate seem unfit for office
* Debunked claims about a candidate’s citizenship, criminal history or activity, or other personal history designed to make that candidate seem unfit or ineligible for office


  
Nextdoor uses a combination of technology and neighbor reports to identify and remove content, as appropriate, that violates our election misinformation policy. 
Medical Misinformation
----------------------


Nextdoor’s Community Guidelines are designed to earn and retain neighbors’ trust by ensuring that content on the platform is authentic, reliable, and useful. Medical misinformation can lead to damaging discourse online, and when left unchecked, can pose a serious threat to public health and be detrimental to communities. As a commitment to neighbor safety, we prohibit medically unsupported health claims that risk public health and safety. This includes but is not limited to the promotion of anti\-vaccination advice, false cures, or misinformation about public health emergencies or crises. 


Anti\-Vaccine Advice
--------------------


As a commitment to neighbor safety, we prohibit misinformation about vaccines that has the potential to cause harm or threatens public safety.  We rely on trusted public health resources to evaluate content that may be misinformation, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    
  
Nextdoor prohibits false or misleading statements and conspiracy theories about vaccines that could prevent or discourage people from receiving vaccines, including claims that: 


* Vaccines cause autism;
* Vaccines contain microchips;
* Vaccines cause the diseases for which they’re intended to prevent;
* Vaccines contain unsafe toxins that are poisonous or harmful.


Health Emergencies
------------------


Neighbors turn to Nextdoor to lend a hand, lean on others when they need help the most and connect with local authorities that provide relevant, real\-time information. Nextdoor works closely with government partners, both local and national, to share important, substantiated news and information on evolving health emergencies as well as their corresponding vaccines and treatments.  
  
To ensure that our neighbors receive trustworthy and helpful information, Nextdoor prohibits content that perpetuates false or misleading claims and conspiracy theories about health emergencies, including their causes, cures, and prevention methods that might be harmful to neighbors and communities. Health emergencies are a dynamic situation, and we work to align any action we take with the guidelines of trusted public health officials, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   
  
**Nextdoor’s misinformation policy prohibits content such as:**


* False or misleading claims and conspiracy theories about COVID\-19, including its causes, cures, and prevention methods;
* False or misleading information that could prevent or discourage people from receiving COVID\-19 testing, treatment or COVID\-19 vaccines;
* Messages that call for or could interfere with the legitimate distribution of COVID\-19 testing or COVID\-19 vaccines, including fraudulent information around the distribution, safety or efficacy of vaccinations.


 

**PLEASE NOTE**  
Reports of misinformation are reviewed by Nextdoor staff, not Leads.
