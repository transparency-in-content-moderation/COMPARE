Stack Exchange Network Acceptable Use Policy
--------------------------------------------




The intent of this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) is to clarify what we at Stack Exchange, Inc. (“Stack Exchange”, “we” or “us”) consider to be acceptable use of any website or service provided on Stack Exchange’s set of related Internet sites and other applications for contributed and curated content (the “Network”).
If you are found to be in violation of any of the below sections, your access to the Network may be restricted or terminated without notice, and your content may be removed at our discretion. When it is possible to do so, Stack Exchange will make a good\-faith effort to provide you with advance notice of actions we take under this AUP, and we will do our best to work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases. You may appeal any action we take under this AUP via our contact form.
Illegal Use. The Network may not be used for illegal purposes. You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations that are applicable to you, whether or not such illegal purposes are explicitly raised in this AUP or our Code of Conduct. This restriction encompasses any defamation and libel laws that apply to you.
Spam. You may not post content for the purpose of affiliated marketing (e.g., to promote a product, service, or similar in a way that is unsolicited or lacks disclosure of affiliation), or use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic. Posting irrelevant content, non\-meaningful content, or other types of content that may reasonably be interpreted as spam per individual site policies, is also prohibited.
Phishing. You may not use the service in any way that deceives users into disclosing sensitive information they would otherwise not disclose, such as passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information.
Doxing Disclosing personally identifiable information of a person or group of people, that hasn’t been manifestly made public, without their explicit consent is not allowed, whether or not that information is accurate. This includes such information as financial information, government\-issued identification, passwords, phone numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that may pose a safety or security risk, including usernames and e\-mail addresses.
Malicious URLs You may not post URLs that were created for the purpose of promoting a scam, attack, or fraud.
Identity Theft You may not falsely represent yourself as a real person or entity you are not.
Disruptions and Exploits You may not attempt to exploit, overload, or otherwise disrupt the operations of the Network.
Unauthorized Use of Intellectual Property You may not post content that infringes on another’s intellectual property right, including trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right. While the use of copyrighted material does not constitute copyright infringement in all cases, users should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it and adhere to any license requirements (e.g., attribution, notice, etc.). Stack Exchange complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and you may view our process for reporting DMCA complaints.
Mass Registration and Automation You may not register accounts en masse, either by hand or through the use of automated tools, without prior written approval of Stack Exchange, Inc. Please contact legal@stackoverflow.com to request approval.
Sexually Explicit Material You may not post content, or links to content, that is sexually explicit in nature, unless it falls within a reasonable interpretation of a Network site’s scope and purpose. However, you may never post content portraying the sexual exploitation or abuse of minors. For the sake of clarity, sexually explicit content is “material that is explicitly sexual, pornographic, prurient, or lascivious in nature,” as defined in our Code of Conduct.
Framing and Mirroring You may not manipulate or otherwise simulate the appearance or function of the Network by using framing, mirroring, or similar other methods, such as by creating deep links to the Network or directly framing our site on another domain. This restriction does not apply for accessibility\-related usages such as screen readers. Please contact legal@stackoverflow.com with any inquiries.


Content Scraping
You may not use any automated data\-gathering means (including robots, spiders, scrapers, crawlers, and the like) to gather any text, files, audio or visual media, profile information, or any other content from any Network website for any use that violates the Public Network Terms of Service, including the content license, or this Acceptable Use Policy.


 Your usage of automated data\-gathering means is exempt from this policy if either:
 1. Such automated data\-gathering is necessary for accessibility\-related reasons.
2. You have obtained our express written prior consent. (You may contact legal@stackoverflow.com with any inquiries.)








Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------





 We have outlined key forms of unacceptable behavior across the entire platform:
 






Abusive behavior

 We do not allow harassment nor any content that promotes, encourages, glorifies, or threatens acts of violence. We also do not allow causing or contributing to an atmosphere that excludes or marginalizes. Curation activities such as voting (upvotes, downvotes, voting to close, etc) are typically not abusive behaviors. Read more in our Abusive Behavior policy.
 




Sensitive content and imagery

 We do not allow any content that promotes, encourages, provides instruction for, or glorifies suicidal or self\-injurious behaviors. We also do not allow content that promotes, encourages, provides instruction for, or glorifies harm or cruelty. Read more about our Sensitive Content and Imagery policy. If you or someone else is in need of help, please read more on how we treat situations where users are in crisis.
 






Harmful political content

 We do not allow political content that encourages harm to others or that supports, celebrates, or furthers the cause of violent actors and hate organizations. We may, in some places, allow pointed or harsh criticism of political figures, their policies, and governments (including satirical statements) as long as they do not otherwise violate this Code of Conduct. Read more in our Harmful Political Content policy.
 




Misleading information

 We do not allow any content that promotes false, harmful, or misleading information that carries the risk of harm to a person or group of people. We also do not allow content that promotes false or misleading information for the purpose of promoting the interests of a political party, government, or ideology. Read more in our Misleading information policy.
 






Disruptive use of tooling

 We do not allow any use of privileges in a targeted and disruptive manner that causes harm to the community or compromises the integrity of the content. Read more about our Disruptive Use policy.
 




Inauthentic Usage

 We do not allow any use of the system that violates our Acceptable Use policy or directly causes unnecessary and unwanted disruption and/or harm to users and/or the network. Read more about our Inauthentic Usage policy.
 







Abusive behavior policy
=======================


We believe knowledge\-sharing happens when people feel safe collaborating and that historically marginalized and underrepresented groups are disproportionately impacted by online abuse. We are committed to building and serving a diverse community of people who have labored to create the repository of information on Stack Exchange.


To ensure that all users feel safe and welcome, we do not allow behaviors or content that cause or contribute to an atmosphere that excludes, marginalizes, or dehumanizes individuals or communities on the basis of their actual or perceived ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, or held religious beliefs. We also don't allow promoting, encouraging, or threatening acts of violence.


Conduct that falls under this category includes, but is not limited to, the below definitions:


* **Bullying and Harassment** \- severe, repeated, or persistent unsolicited conduct, misuse of power or tools, or attacks that target specific users or groups of people in a manner that causes harm. Content that contributes to a hostile or threatening environment, denies a person's expressed gender identity, or invalidates a person's individual experiences in a manner that causes harm.
* **Hostile comments** – malicious, unkind, cruel, or mocking comments that provoke or insult another person, including (but not limited to) the usage of gendered cursing terms in a derogatory way.
* **Dangerous speech** – any form of expression (e.g. text, images, or speech) that represents rhetoric that demonizes or denigrates a group of people in a way that depicts them as threats so serious that violence against them becomes acceptable or necessary; rhetoric that increases the risk of violence being condoned or committed against a particular group. *This policy is inspired by the Dangerous Speech Project.*
* **Bigotry \& Discrimination** – the poor treatment, expressed irrational suspicion, hatred, targeting, and/or intolerance of another person or group of people due to their ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, or held religious beliefs.
* **Dehumanization** – depriving individuals or groups of people of their perceived humanity and dignity, for example, by comparing humans, groups, or their stated or perceived behaviors in a derogatory manner with non\-human entities such as animals perceived as inferior, bacteria, viruses, microbes, diseases, infections, filth, and other qualifiers.
* **Extremism** – promoting or supporting violent actors, hateful organizations, or groups organized under a common name, sign, or symbol that promotes an ideology of bigotry and discrimination, heavily advocates for violence against others or are tied to activities such as homicide, drug trafficking, kidnapping, acts of mass violence, and spree killing.

Sensitive content and imagery policy
====================================


Because we want to encourage the open sharing of knowledge on a variety of topics, we do not allow content or imagery that is non\-consensual, dehumanizing, or content that promotes, encourages, provides instruction for, or is the glorification of harm or cruelty, to people or animals.


Content that falls under this category includes (but is not limited to):


* **Non\-consensual imagery** – photos or videos of an individual in the nude, or sexually suggestive in nature, that have been taken or distributed without their knowledge or consent.
* **Sexually Explicit Material** – material that is explicitly sexual, pornographic, prurient, or lascivious in nature.
* **Imagery of victims** – the lurid or gratuitous sharing of photos or videos depicting victims of violent acts, including but not limited to torture, mutilation, or dismemberment.
* **Hateful imagery** – imagery or symbols used in a manner that dehumanizes, mocks, or contributes to an atmosphere of harassment, intimidation, as well as indirect threats against an individual or community on the basis of their actual or perceived ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, or held religious beliefs.
* **Mocking content** – targeted content that overtly makes fun of, jeers at, or treats other users with contempt in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as causing harm.
* **Content glorifying harm** \- content that is the celebration or praise of acts of harm or violence committed against or befalling a person or group of people.
* **Self\-harm** – content or imagery that promotes, encourages, provides instructions for, or glorifies suicidal or self\-injurious behaviors, including unhealthy undereating or overeating, and unhealthy amounts of exercise. Read more in our Self\-harm and suicide policy.

Harmful political content policy
================================


The spirit of this policy is to create and maintain rules and guidelines that allow users to share knowledge and discuss challenging topics safely and peacefully while still allowing a decent level of scrutiny to governments.


We **do not** allow advocating for violence or encouraging harm to others. We do not allow discriminatory content towards a person’s actual or perceived ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and/or disabilities. We also do not allow content that supports, celebrates, or furthers the cause of extremist organizations as per our Abusive Behavior policy.


While on our sites users are expected to be factual, respectful, and objective while participating in main Q\&A, user profiles and chat rooms allow for more subtle and nuanced conversations where pointed or harsh criticism of political figures, their policies, and governments (including satirical statements) **can be** allowed as long as they do not otherwise violate the Code of Conduct and do not contain insulting language directed at individuals.


Additionally, we will not allow political misinformation or widely disproven allegations against a political figure not supported by reasonable evidence to be promoted on the platform. Read more in our Misleading information policy.

Misleading information policy
=============================


To ensure the integrity of our network, we do not allow any content that promotes false or misleading information or coordinated misleading information campaigns.


Broadly speaking, we do not allow and may remove misleading information that:


* Is likely to significantly contribute to the risk of physical or psychological harm to a person or a group of people
* Promotes widely disproven claims regarding individual or public health, including but not limited to the safety of vaccines, or the intended usage, benefits, or capabilities of medicine
* Is likely to significantly harm democratic institutions or voting processes or to cause voter or census suppression
* Severely misrepresents a candidate’s or government’s views, plans, or intended actions
* Promotes disproven claims of election fraud or manipulation as factual or severely misrepresents the safety or validity of results from voting machines or other voting processes
* Promotes the specific views of a party, government, or ideology by using false claims regarding others
* Misrepresents, denies, or makes unsubstantiated claims about historical or newsworthy events or the people involved in them


We may also remove media that we deem has been manipulated in a way that misleads, such as:


* Images, videos, or quotes that have been edited, cropped, or synthesized in a way that misleads others about the original content
* Images or videos that have been generated by artificial techniques that superimpose or create content in a manner that appears authentic but isn’t (so\-called “deep fakes”) in order to mislead viewers


Content that falls under this policy can be engaged with in several ways: it may be that editing is enough, it may be that providing a factual answer (using the platform!) is enough, or it may be that it needs to be deleted. We encourage users to exercise their best judgment in how to curate and respond to this type of content and, when in doubt, to flag it or contact us.

Inauthentic usage policy
========================


The success of this thriving community is due to the tireless efforts of its users and their contributions. Malicious or inauthentic acts that interfere with the normal daily operation of the network are not allowed.



 To ensure the integrity of the platform, we do not allow any use of the system that violates our Acceptable Use policy, Security guidance, or directly causes unnecessary and unwanted network load, disruption, and/or harm to users, content, and/or the network.
 


Furthermore, we do not allow what we define as inauthentic usage of our systems, such as:


* Artificially boosting the popularity/score of content and/or users.
* Artificially inflating one’s reputation through targeted voting.
* Patterns of voting that appear to be solely based on rewarding or punishing specific users in a targeted manner or that appear to be cast with disregard to the content being voted on.
* Using multiple accounts and/or profiles to circumvent or evade system, or moderator, imposed restrictions or limitations that one account/profile would have. One individual may use multiple accounts/profiles, provided that none are used to avoid system, or moderator, imposed restrictions or disciplinary limitations, or otherwise violate the rules for using multiple accounts.
* Sharing accounts/profiles between different individuals, even if these individuals work for or represent the same corporation or organization. Each account/profile may represent and be used by only one individual person throughout the lifetime of the profile/account. Stack Exchange may expressly grant written permission that an account/profile is not subject to this restriction.
* Coordinating inauthentic behavior, including, but not limited to, through the use of fake accounts.
* Plagiarizing or copying content from websites, books, or other online and offline tools without proper attribution in a manner that violates our referencing standards.
