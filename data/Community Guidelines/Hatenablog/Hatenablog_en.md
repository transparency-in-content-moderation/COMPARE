What does Hatena think about the Hatena community?



The community we aim for with Hatena and its users
------------------


Hatena provides platforms for users to transmit information, such as Hatena Blog and Hatena Bookmark. Hatena provides these services because we believe that when users transmit information, it has a positive impact on both themselves and the recipients, and improves the Internet and ultimately the world.


This does not simply mean that the content of our messages should be only positive and wonderful. We also need a place where people can share their everyday experiences and simple thoughts, and where they can sometimes express their anger, sadness, and other negative feelings, and reveal their own weaknesses. Hatena aims to be a platform that accepts the diverse expressions of a wide range of people.


**1: Hatena's Mission**





The purpose of these guidelines is to inform you of Hatena's values and philosophy, as well as our policy for dealing with various issues, and to ask for your understanding and cooperation in order to create a better user community.


While individual policies may change from time to time, the underlying values are universal. Please read them carefully.




Values we hold dear in the Hatena community
---------------------


Hatena operates its services based on the following values. These are also matters that we expect the users of our services to keep in mind.




### Respect free expression and healthy communication.


Since the launch of Hatena in 2001, Hatena has consistently respected the free expression and communication of its users. Through its services, Hatena aims to be a place for diverse expression, where users can come into contact with better information and share their experiences with others. We also value the creation and sharing of better wisdom through discussions among users.





### Respect, deference, and an attitude of understanding toward others


Healthy communication requires an attitude of **respect, respect, and understanding** toward others with differing opinions. We believe that rebuttal and criticism are an important part of communication, but without such an attitude, it will simply be offensive and hurtful to others, and will simply be uncomfortable and unhelpful not only to the parties involved, but also to third parties.





### Appropriate distance to different values


Even if you try to maintain an appropriate attitude as described above, if you are unable to discuss a matter, or if you have values that you cannot accept, please follow the "Guidelines for Responding to Inappropriate Content" below, or use the hide function provided by each service. **Please act in a manner that distances rather than excludes**.



Some issues that arise in the community may be difficult for all parties to resolve amicably. In the event of such issues, we will continue to make our best efforts to make the service healthy by making decisions and setting rules in line with the above values.




Hatena is trying to create a good community by valuing communication among users.



Guidelines for Responding to Inappropriate Content
-----------------


Hatena is committed to providing services that expand the community image and values we aim to achieve as outlined above. To this end, several rules exist, including restrictions based on laws and regulations, restrictions for the safety of users, and restrictions to maintain the service.


Below are examples of content and conduct that Hatena deems inappropriate, so please use this information to help you decide what action to take when you see content on the Hatena site that you find objectionable. Please use this information to help you decide what you should do if you see content that is **uncomfortable** on Hatena. Please also follow the rules when posting your own content.




### Copyright infringing content


Please use this content in compliance with copyright laws. If a claim is filed by the rights holder, a procedure will be initiated in accordance with Hatena's Information Deletion Guidelines. Details





### Privacy Content


We prefer that privacy-related information be consistent with the intent of the parties involved. Please do not disclose privacy-related information out of curiosity or with the intent to attack a party. Details





### Content on Child Exploitation


Hatena will take particularly strict measures, including immediate and total suspension, against content related to the exploitation of children, such as child pornography, child prostitution, and child trafficking. Details





### Dangerous and harmful content


Among potentially dangerous information, such as information on suicide and medical information that is not based on scientific evidence, if it is difficult to voluntarily remove the information through a warning recommendation, and if there is a possibility of harm from removing the information, guidance to neutral sources or appropriate consultation services may be inserted by Hatena. Details





### Sexual Content


In principle, Hatena prohibits the posting of pornographic, prostitution, and sexually oriented content, and such use is not permitted. However, if it can be determined that the main purpose of the content is not to arouse obscene interest, but to be used within the scope of normal human life, Hatena may not take any special action, or may limit the posting of such content to the listings by zoning, or may simply issue a warning to users. Details





### Offensive Content


In general, expressions that people find offensive are not fixed and can vary depending on various factors, such as individual preferences and the circumstances under which the same individual is viewing the site. For this reason, we will not delete information based solely on the opinion that it is offensive. However, depending on the content, we may take measures such as restricting the scope of display, such as removing the information from the list page, or zoning the information to users with specific attributes or pre-defined preferences.





### Discriminatory Content


Hatena prohibits discriminatory expressions based on race, ethnicity, creed, gender, social status, place of residence, physical characteristics, medical history, education, property and income. Naturally, we strictly prohibit the continuous use of abusive language based on the above attributes, personal attacks, and hate speech that suggests violence or harm, or calls for the broad exclusion of such behavior. Details





### Other illegal content


When publishing information on the Internet, in addition to the copyright laws and personal rights protections listed above, there are other laws and regulations that must be observed, such as the Pharmaceutical Machine Law and the Public Office Election Law. Content that violates these laws and regulations is not only subject to anti-transmission measures, but may also be subject to compensation claims, fines, imprisonment, and other punishments.





### libel / slander / defamation / insult


Please understand that you are responsible for the content of your own expression, and if you intend your expression to be particularly critical, please re-read the Guidelines for Deletion of Information to make sure that your expression is correct. Details





### Harassment / Harrassment


Repeated insistence on a particular person, such as when an argument or rebuttal is unacceptable, or persistent and persistent behavior that exceeds the generally acceptable range of behavior, may be considered harassment or harassment to the user or community. Hatena may issue cautions or warnings or take measures such as suspension of use after reviewing past usage. Details





### Violation of Terms of Use/Guidelines / Spamming


The Hatena Terms of Service and guidelines for each service have been established to protect users, communities, and services. Please check the guidelines carefully, as unintentional violations of the guidelines or spamming may result in the loss of service due to the nature of the service. Details





### Conduct not in accordance with instructions from Hatena


Hatena may send warnings for inappropriate use. If you do not follow the warning, or if you do follow the warning but continue to use the site inappropriately, we will take measures to suspend your use of the site.





### Other inappropriate behavior


Actions taken by Hatena will basically be based on whether or not a user violates the prohibitions enumerated in Hatena's "Hatena Terms of Use" or the "Guidelines for Dealing with Inappropriate Content" listed below, and will not be taken arbitrarily. However, we will take measures such as warnings or suspension of use if we determine, after careful consideration in accordance with the principles of these Guidelines, that conduct that is not clearly defined is detrimental to users, the community, or the provision of services.





We have to make sure we don't post anything that isn't good or that will bother anyone.



Hatena's Discovery of and Response to Inappropriate Content
-----------------------


Hatena does not, in principle, **pre-censor content posted by users**. Inappropriate content is detected by the following means. We cannot guarantee that inappropriate content will always be detected. Even if content is deemed inappropriate, we may decide not to disclose it or suspend its use for a variety of reasons.




### Patrol and monitoring by Hatena


We will check postings through mechanical methods of detection and visual inspection. However, we do not guarantee constant patrolling or exhaustive monitoring of all postings.





### Responding to calls and inquiries


The service will have a user reporting contact point if necessary.


There is no guarantee that the service will respond to the whistleblower's wishes. For example, even if multiple users report a problem, no special action will be taken if the subject of the report is not subject to action under the guidelines.


For services that do not have a reporting desk, reports will be accepted from the contact point.





### Legal Procedure


If we receive a request for removal based on the Provider Liability Limitation Act, we will respond in accordance with the guidelines and in compliance with laws and regulations.


Hatena's governing law is Japanese law. Requests for removal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (commonly known as the DMCA), which is a law of the United States, will not result in immediate suspension of publication, but will be handled in accordance with the Provider Liability Limitation Act.





### Public Agency Requests


If we receive a request from the police or government ministries and agencies to remove content as illegal, we will comply with the request in principle.


When we receive a removal request from an educational institution for the protection of children, or from the Illegal and Harmful Information Hotline Center, we will comply with the above.





### Other blacklists provided by public interest groups, etc.


We may use blacklists provided by external public interest groups, mainly for automated monitoring of abuse. However, the neutrality and fairness of the list will be thoroughly verified before it is used.





Disclosure of information to users
----------


In the event of suspension of use or other action, the reason for such action will be notified by e-mail to the registered e-mail address (except in cases where there is a method specified for each service). **With the exception of some emergency responses, we generally do not take action without notification**. If the e-mail is not received, please contact us through the inquiry window. However, we may not disclose the following information.


* Cases in which disclosure may encourage inappropriate expressions that belong to the gray zone, such as specific criteria for judging whether an expression is acceptable or not.
* Information that could be used to avoid judgment by reverse engineering, such as whether or not the account is subject to judgment, or the reasons or criteria for judgment, mainly with regard to judgment on abuse, such as spamming.
* Cases in which multiple notices are sent to the same user, such as when multiple accounts are being used inappropriately, or when a user who has already had his/her account suspended has obtained another account and is using it again.
* When the same reason has already been disclosed in the past, such as the same inappropriate use is being made again.




Hatena tries to deal with rule violations as fairly as possible, doesn't it?



Towards a better future than now.
--------------


The value of Hatena's services is based on the diverse information transmission by diverse people. However, in a place where people with different values interact, various problems can arise.


While it is easy to understand the measures taken to limit information dissemination or avoid diversity because of the problems that may arise, it is an option Hatena would like to avoid as much as possible.


This is because we believe that such problems are not unique to web services, but can occur among families, friends, communities, workplaces, nations, and ethnic groups alike, and that they are unavoidable and serious issues that must be addressed if people are to live together with others.


If, through the Hatena community, we can establish ideas, rules, systems, and methods of information dissemination that will eventually lead to mutual understanding and enrich the exchange of information among diverse people, despite occasional conflicts, I believe that this wisdom can be shared in a more universal way, as wisdom that leads to harmonious coexistence. If we can establish ideas, rules, systems, and methods of information transmission that will ultimately lead to mutual understanding and enrich the exchange of information, it will become something that can be shared in a more universal form as wisdom that leads to coexistence.


This may be a very difficult task. However, we would like to make it happen, little by little, together with our users. Please cooperate with us.




We will do our best to create a good Internet!
