Patriots is not a catch\-all free speech community for the political right.


We are explicitly for supporters of MAGA and Trump, and we facilitate a platform where those users specifically can speak their mind.


#### **Be here for MAGA and Trump.**


We’re a community for those who want to “make America great again”, by way of Donald J. Trump. If your purpose here is to push other unrelated or tangential agendas, you’re not welcome.


#### **High Energy**


No forum sliding, consensus cracking, topic dilution, etc.


#### **No Racism**


No genuine racism, including slurs, non\-factual content, and general unfounded bigotry.


#### **No Doxing**


No doxxing of yourself or others, including revealing PII of non\-public figures (unless covered by media), as well as addresses, phone numbers, etc. of public figures.


#### **No Advertising**


Promoting products, fundraising, or posting web properties in which you have a financial interest is not permitted.


#### **Questions and Concerns**


Exhaust private channels (such as mod mail) before going public with concerns about our team. Bring evidence and logical reasoning; we won’t allow unfounded accusations intended to degrade trust in us.


#### **Follow the Content Policy**


Follow the platform’s Content Policy \- which we may sum up as “follow the law, don’t spam, don’t dox, and don’t manipulate or abuse the voting system.”


#### **Transparency:** view our bans.
