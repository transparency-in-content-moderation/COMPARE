ReverbNation Abuse Policy
-------------------------








#### Revised as of February 4, 2022






BandLab Singapore Pte. Ltd. (together with its affiliates, successors, and assigns, hereinafter referred to as “REVERBNATION”, “OUR”, “WE”, or “US”) have adopted this Abuse Policy (the “Abuse Policy”). The Abuse Policy applies to the website www.reverbnation.com (the “Site”) to address claims of abuse.


To balance the needs and interests of all of our users, we may prohibit content that does not meet the Site content standards outlined in this Abuse Policy.


Please review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression and content is acceptable, and what type of content may be reported and removed.


If you need to report abusive behavior to us, please review the Abuse Policy in its entirety and contact us via the dedicated Abuse email address listed below.


If you believe you may be in danger, please contact your local law enforcement authorities in addition to reporting the content to us so that the situation can be addressed both online and offline.








#### SITE CONTENT STANDARDS


* **Violence and Threats**


Safety is our primary priority. We may remove content without notice to you and may escalate to appropriate law enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat to public safety. Users may not threaten others, or organize acts of violence. Organizations with a record of violent criminal activity are not permitted to maintain a presence on the Site and their profiles removed from the Site. Targeted abuse or harassment is a violation of the General Terms and Conditions.


* **Bullying and Harassment**


We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. We take action on all valid reports we receive regarding abusive behavior directed at other users.


* **Hate Speech**


We do not permit hate speech. ReverbNation does not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition.


* **Graphic Content**


Graphic images shared to celebrate or glorify violence are not permitted on the Site.


* **Pornography and Nudity**


We have a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also may impose limitations on the display of nudity. We may remove material we deem obscene or pornographic.


* **Self\-Harm**


We may remove any promotion or encouragement of self\-harm, or drug abuse.


* **Identity and Privacy**


We ask that users refrain from publishing the personal information of others without their consent. Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for another artist or organization, or creating multiple accounts violates the General Terms and Conditions and the Trademark Policy.


* **Intellectual Property**


Before posting content to the Site, please be sure you have the right to do so. We require that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights at all times. Infringing the intellectual property rights of others violates the General Terms and Conditions and/or the Trademark Policy.


* **SPAM and Phishing**


We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security. We also require that you respect our users by not contacting them for commercial purposes.


* **Security**


We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security, including those that use fraud or deception. Additionally, we ask that you respect our members by not contacting them for commercial purposes.


* **User Disputes**


ReverbNation provides a platform which encompasses a variety of users with different voices, ideas and perspectives. As a policy, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users, unless the actions of a user violate the Abuse Policy, the General Terms and Conditions, or other applicable policy.


* **Offensive Content**


Users are allowed to post content, including potentially inflammatory content, provided they do not violate the General Terms and Conditions or another applicable policy. ReverbNation does not screen content and does not remove potentially offensive content unless such content violates the Abuse Policy, another applicable policy, or the General Terms and Conditions.


If you believe the content or behavior you are reporting is prohibited in your local jurisdiction, please contact your local authorities so they can accurately assess the content or behavior for possible violations of local law. If ReverbNation is contacted directly by law enforcement, we can work with them and provide assistance for their investigation.








#### TAKE THREATS SERIOUSLY


If you believe you are in physical danger, contact the local law enforcement authorities who have the tools to address the issue immediately!


If you decide to work with law enforcement, make sure to do the following:


* 1\. Document the violent or abusive content or messages with print\-outs or screenshots;
* 2\. Be as specific as possible about why you are concerned;
* 3\. Provide any context you have around who you believe might be involved, such as evidence of abusive behavior found on other websites;
* 4\. Provide any information regarding previous threats you may have received.


You can also report the content to us via our dedicated Abuse email address listed below.








#### WHEN TO REPORT ABUSE


Simply because a user disagrees with or receives unwanted communication, such behavior does not necessarily constitute online abuse. Please utilize your account settings in order to control who can comment on your user profile and/or contact you. Only if two users are mutual fans of each other can they send and receive direct messages to each other. To block another user from sending you direct messages simply log in, go to that user’s profile page, select Fan Settings, and uncheck the box “I want to be a fan of.” To prevent other users from Commenting on your profile, log in, go to Account, Preferences, Comment Settings, and select “Always Block.” You may also browse other user’s profiles anonymously by logging in, going to Account, Preferences, Browsing Settings, and then checking the “Browse Anonymously” box. If a user sees a comment on their profile or receives a message the user does not like, then the user should simply take the above\-mentioned steps to end any communication with that user.


Abusive users often lose interest once they realize that you will not respond. If the user in question is a friend, try addressing the issue offline. If you have had a misunderstanding, it may be possible to clear the matter up face to face or with the help of a trusted individual.


If you continue receiving unwanted, targeted and continuous communications, and feel it constitutes online abuse, consider reporting the behavior to us via the dedicated Abuse email address listed below.


If you are a minor, and you know who the person is that is harassing you, please let a parent, teacher, or trusted adult know so they may assist.








#### REPORTING ABUSE POLICY VIOLATIONS


If you see something on the Site that you believe violates the Abuse Policy or the General Terms and Conditions, you should report it to us. Please keep in mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site.


It is possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over comments, and who may contact you.


Valid Abuse Reports must contain the following information:


* 1\. Your full name.
* 2\. Your email.
* 3\. Your address.
* 4\. ReverbNation username.
* 5\. How you are involved.
* 6\. What you are reporting.
* 7\. If the threat of physical harm is involved.
* 8\. The username causing the issue.
* 9\. Specific examples as evidence of the issue.
* 10\. At least one direct link to the content being reporting; more links help to establish patterns.
* 11\. Your Physical or Electronic Signature.


An Abuse Report Form is available for your convenience.

#### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


**Who can report abusive behavior on the Site?**


In order to investigate reports of abusive behavior, violent threats or a breach of privacy, we need to be in contact with the actual person affected or their authorized representative. We are unable to respond to requests from uninvolved parties regarding those issues to mitigate the likelihood of false or unauthorized reports. If you are not an authorized representative but you are in contact with the individual, encourage the individual to file a report through our Abuse Report Form.


**Can ReverbNation give me another user’s information?**


Per our Privacy Policy, we do not release user information except as required by valid legal process. If you are working with the police or your lawyer, they will be able to help you with the appropriate correct legal process for obtaining such information. If we are contacted directly by law enforcement, we may work with them and provide assistance for their investigation.


**What should I do if I receive a violent threat?**


If someone has communicated a violent threat to you via the Site that you feel is credible, contact law enforcement so they can accurately assess the validity of the threat. Websites do not have the ability to investigate and assess a threat, bring charges or prosecute individuals. If contacted by law enforcement directly, we can work with them and provide the necessary information for their investigation of your issue.
