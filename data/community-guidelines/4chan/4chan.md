8. Complaining about 4chan (its policies, moderation, etc) on the imageboards may result in post deletion and a ban.
9. Evading your ban will result in a permanent one. Instead, wait and appeal it!
10. No spamming or flooding of any kind. No intentionally evading spam or post filters.
11. Advertising (all forms) is not welcomeâ€”this includes any type of referral linking, "offers", soliciting, begging, stream threads, etc.

16. All request threads for adult content belong on /r/, and all request threads for work\-safe content belong on /wsr/, unless otherwise noted.
17. Do not upload images containing additional data such as embedded sounds, documents, archives, etc.


Global rules apply to all boards unless otherwise noted.  
  

Remember: The use of 4chan is a privilege, not a right. The 4chan moderation team reserves the right to revoke access and remove content for any reason without notice.
