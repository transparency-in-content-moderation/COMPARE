Community Guidelines
====================

Peanut’s mission is to provide a safe, inclusive space for women to connect and share stories.

We recognize how important it is to feel safe online, so these Guidelines outline what is and isn’t welcome on our platform. If your content breaches our Guidelines, you may lose access to Peanut.

We love seeing
--------------

Inclusivity
-----------

Having a diverse community with varied content helps every woman feel seen, heard, and welcome on the platform. Our community welcomes non\-binary identified, cis, and transwomen.

Kindness and authenticity
-------------------------

Peanut is built on trust and having an authentic community helps us create a safe space. Treat each other with kindness and be respectful of others' opinions.

Meaningful connections
----------------------

Finding connections through shared experience helps us know we’re not alone. Listen, support, share and pay it forward.

Respectful conversations
------------------------

We understand the imperfect nature of womanhood and that sometimes you’re unable to continue messaging. Be honest, direct, and avoid ghosting one another.

What we don’t want to see
-------------------------

Impersonation
-------------

Only upload photos that are yours. We take authenticity really seriously and everyone in the community must have a selfie\-verified profile. Duplicate and shared accounts aren’t permitted.

Misinformation
--------------

While we encourage respectful conversations about meaningful subjects, we don’t permit content that is inaccurate, false and causes harm to our community, such as misinformation about vaccines.

Plagiarism
----------

We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Any content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights without credit isn’t allowed on Peanut.

Hateful behavior
----------------

We have a zero\-tolerance policy for any content that contains hate speech. This includes (but is not limited to) content that attacks, threatens, incites violence against, or otherwise dehumanizes an individual or group across:

• Race

• Ethnicity

• Religion

• Sexual orientation

• Disability

• Gender identity

• Age

• Socioeconomic status

Harassment and bullying
-----------------------

We do not tolerate anyone being shamed, bullied, or harassed. This behavior can come in many forms, from making threats and releasing personally identifiable information to sending unwanted messages and screenshotting content without permission.

False reporting
---------------

Reporting bad behavior across Peanut helps keep our community safe. We don’t tolerate intentional and repeated misuse of this tool, such as submitting reports in retaliation to personal disagreements.

Harmful and sexual activities
-----------------------------

We care deeply about the wellbeing of our community and minors. We don’t tolerate any content that perpetuates the abuse, harm, or exploitation of minors. We don’t permit nudity, pornography, sexually explicit content or sexual solicitation

Illegal activities
------------------

Criminal activities cover a wide range of acts punishable by law, including theft, exploitation, and other harmful behavior. To prevent such behavior from being facilitated, we may remove content relating to criminal activities.

Advertising
-----------

Peanut is a safe space free from advertising. This includes (but is not limited to):

• Buying or selling items

• Promoting or offering wish lists or ‘gifting’ sites

• Requesting payment or linking to payment websites

• Requests for financial aid or via external websites (eg. Cash App or GoFundMe)

• Posts about raising money on behalf of other individuals

• Promoting social media accounts for the purpose of recruitment

Our community is rooted in care and accountability, so if you spot any content that breaches our Guidelines, please report it.
