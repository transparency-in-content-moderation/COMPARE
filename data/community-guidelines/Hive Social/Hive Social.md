To keep our Hive community authentic
------------------------------------

You own the content you post on Hive, however, you are only allowed to post photos and/or videos that you have taken or have the right to post. Be yourself!  
  
Impersonation will result in your account being deleted.

To keep our Hive community appropriate
--------------------------------------

We understand that you may want to share nude images that are inherently artistic or creative in essence. This includes photos, videos, and digitally\-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and nude close\-ups, as well as nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures. This content will be categorized as NSFW Mature Content.  
  
When posting NSFW Mature Content, please toggle the NSFW button to On in Post Settings. This will prevent your content from being shown to minors and prevent account/post deletion.   
  
If your NSFW content is not tagged as NSFW, users may report your post and it will consequently be deleted. Repeated violations will lead to account deletion.   
  
To ensure you can see NSFW posts, please enter your Privacy and Safety Settings, tap NSFW Mature Content, and switch the button to On. You will then be able to see posts tagged as NSFW.

To keep our Hive community spam\-free
-------------------------------------

You are not allowed to artificially collect likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent.  
  
  
Performing any of the above actions will result in your account being deleted.

To keep our Hive community respectful
-------------------------------------

We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that maliciously targets private individuals, personal information intended to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. Hive prohibits its users to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we request that you express your intent clearly to prevent wrongful removal of your content or suspension and/or termination of your account. Threats of harm to the public (including threats of physical harm, theft, vandalism and all forms of financial harm) and personal safety aren't allowed. Hive carefully review reports of threats to determine whether a threat is credible.  
  
If Hive determines that a threat is not credible and you feel that it is, please contact our support team directly at support@hivesocial.app so that we can revise our original decision based upon new information or specific details that you retain factual knowledge of.

To keep our Hive community safe
-------------------------------

You are not allowed to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not allowed. Hive also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick\-and\-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species or their parts.  


Zero Tolerance

We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to post intimate images of others.  


Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account
---------------------------------------------------------

Failing to adhere to Hive Community Guidelines will result in the suspension and/or termination of your Hive account. TheHive, Inc. reserves the right to remove content or information you share on Hive if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our Hive Community Guidelines, or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, graphic violence, impersonation, unlawful conduct, harassment, violate these Terms of Use or Hive Community Guidelines, if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our support team at support@hivesocial.app.  
  
Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below called “Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree,“ will still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.

You can report directly from an individual post for specific violations, including: spam, abusive or harmful content, inappropriate ads, self\-harm, nudity, and impersonation. Our Hive Support Team will review your report of said post, and if necessary, the Hive Support Team will take action towards the users account up to termination.
