Flickr’s Community Guidelines
=============================

Every day, the global Flickr community, including Flickr members and Flickr staff, works together to make Flickr the safest and most inclusive community for photography enthusiasts. Flickr is a place to share your work, get inspired by the photography and art of others, and to connect with people who share your interests.

These community guidelines are meant to help us along our collective journey of pushing our own photography further and illuminating the discourse, stories, people, and perspectives behind each photo, comment, album, gallery, and more.

Thank you for being here, for being an active participant in this community, and for helping us and your fellow community members uphold these guidelines.


## Participating in the Flickr community.


* **Respect your fellow Flickr members.** Act with care and patience for your fellow community members. Remember that we are all here to share and appreciate photography. This includes everyone on Flickr––whether they’re new to the community, a staff member, or someone who has been here since day one.

* **Be constructive with your critiques, comments, and feedback.** If someone has asked for feedback or help, put yourself in their shoes. Aim to be clear, constructive, and specific.

* **Safety levels exist to make the whole community safer.** Using the appropriate [safety levels](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404064374164-Set-the-Safety-Levels-of-Your-Flickr-Content-or-Account) ensures that your work is seen by your intended audience and that your content remains safely stored on Flickr. Whether you just joined Flickr or you’ve been sharing for years, make a habit of routinely checking your upload settings and the safety levels you’ve set for your work.

* **Connect like a human, not like a robot.** Act genuinely and thoughtfully when you’re engaging with your fellow Flickr members. Behaviors like mass-faveing, participating in a group without reading its rules, or copying, pasting, and posting the same comment on multiple photos may come off as disingenuous.

* **Be thoughtful about how you use the tools and services that Flickr provides.** Shady use of our API is likely to get your API key terminated. Actively tend to any groups that you admin. Don’t use Flickr to spam others or to host illegal content, including but not limited to drug use, [CSAM](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419502786580-Combatting-child-sexual-abuse-material), and others. Use the tools on Flickr constructively or you risk losing access to certain tools, privileges, or your account altogether.

* **Know that there are some behaviors that we simply won’t tolerate.** Don’t use hate speech, threaten another member’s safety or privacy, or harass anyone. In spaces that are operated by Flickr, like our official groups or Flickr’s photostream, we will always strive to protect the safety of marginalized community members. Comments or activity that take space from the intended audience will not be allowed.


## Respecting photography.

* **Respect the photography.** If you love a photo, great! Let the photographer know. If you don’t love a photo, please defer to guideline #1 and remember that Flickr is a diverse community made up of people with different interests, perspectives, and identities. Respect all the genres of photography and art and the effort it takes to create them.

* **Use your Flickr account to share your work.** Whether you’re a virtual photographer, birder, train watcher, etc., Flickr is a home for you and your work. But please don’t upload photos or content that does not belong to you (we have other tools to show appreciation for others’ photos—like faves and galleries). If you believe someone has uploaded content to Flickr that infringes your copyright, please let us know by using the [Copyright Infringement Form](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404063895956-Copyright-and-Intellectual-Property-Policy).

* **Respect the subjects of your work.** Keep the subjects of your photos in mind when you’re sharing on Flickr. Do you have their permission to share publicly? Is the photo meant for your friends and family only?

* **Give some grace.** When you choose to grant permission to your photos under any [open license](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404070159636-Creative-Commons) available on Flickr, we ask that you give the reuser a 30-day grace period to fix any possible mistake or misuse of your CC-licensed work with no penalty. Failure to allow a good faith reuser the opportunity to correct errors is against the intent of the license and not in line with the values of our community, and can result in your account being removed. If you use CC licenses, please understand that we support and adhere to the strategy for addressing license enforcement described in the [Creative Commons’ Statement of Enforcement Principles](https://creativecommons.org/license-enforcement/enforcement-principles/).


## Enforcement.

* Flickr’s community guidelines are enforced and upheld by Flickr staff and the Flickr community. If you need to report a specific behavior to our team, here are the [steps you can take](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404057906068-How-to-report-Community-Guidelines-violations).

* In most cases, when a community member violates a community guideline, our Trust and Safety team will reach out to them via email. We’ll be clear about the infraction, the applicable guideline, and the potential consequences. However, in cases where behavior seems irredeemable, we may not.

* Consequences may start with a reminder of the community guidelines but can also result in the removal of content, loss of certain account privileges or access to certain tools, or being removed and banned from Flickr altogether.

The above guidelines cover the basics that every Flickr member should know and operate by when using Flickr. We also have detailed [policy documentation](https://www.flickr.com/help/terms) that may be applicable to you based on how you use Flickr. Please visit our [Help Center](https://www.flickrhelp.com/) to reference these policies.
