Steam includes a variety of community features that support custom user\-generated content. Whether uploading workshop items, personalizing profiles, reviewing products, or posting in the discussions, custom content greatly improves the experience for players in the Steam Community.  
  
Because so many players have access to this content, it is important that it be appropriate for everyone using Steam’s all\-ages and international community. We expect that anyone participating in the community make a reasonable judgment about whether their contributions are appropriate.  
  
We also understand that it is challenging to evaluate appropriateness within such a large and diverse community. These rules aim to make that evaluation easier for anyone participating in the community.

Frequently Asked Questions  
* How are these guidelines enforced?
* How can content be reported?
* What are Mature Content Preferences?
* What if content was removed by mistake?
* Why do moderators lock and delete discussions?
* What happens when these guidelines are violated?

  
How are these guidelines enforced?Steam moderators review reported content in conjunction with these guidelines to determine when content should be removed from the community. The examples above give an idea of what type of content is not acceptable, but they are not comprehensive.  
  
How can content be reported?We encourage players to report any content that they believe to be in violation of these guidelines.  
  
Detailed instructions for how to report each type of content are available in our Reported Content article.  
  
What are Mature Content Preferences?Every player on Steam has account preferences related to mature content. These preferences determine the types of games and community content that are shown to that player on Steam.   
  
What if my content was removed by mistake?We understand the challenge of judging the appropriateness of the content that players upload and we’re not always going to get it right. On top of that, subjectivity and context always come into play when applying guidelines to unique content. Feedback from the community helps ensure that we are applying these rules correctly.  
  
If you ever feel that content was mistakenly moderated, you should contact Steam Support. Support can review the content and help you better understand the reasoning or even correct a mistake.  
  
Additionally, moderation messages that accompany the content removal will include a direct link to appeal the decision with Steam Support.  
  
Why do moderators lock and delete discussions?Respectful arguments are a constructive and beneficial aspect of the Steam Community. When a discussion thread veers off a constructive path or is causing frequent disrespect between players, Steam moderators will lock the thread.  
  
If a discussion thread contains prohibited topics, spam, or is otherwise not constructive, moderators may also delete specific content in an effort to preserve the conversation. However, there are cases where removing the thread itself is necessary.  
  
What happens when these guidelines are violated?Content removal: Content in violation of these guidelines will be removed from Steam. Generally, you will receive a notification if this occurs, with further information and an option to contact support.  
  
Cooldown for specific features: The ability to use community features relevant to the banned content may be temporarily removed from the account. For example, if an avatar is removed, the account will lose the ability to upload a new avatar until the cooldown has expired.   
  
Loss of all community features: Accounts that repeatedly violate these guidelines risk temporarily or permanently losing the ability to use all features within the Steam Community.
