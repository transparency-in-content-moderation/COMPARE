When SCT violates the community norms, the SCT platform will handle and notify the offending content and users accordingly. Any objections to the processing results can be fed back through APP\- Help and Customer Service\- Notes/Account Complaints.


 At the same time, the maintenance of the community environment can not be separated from the joint efforts of all the little sweet potatoes, we welcome the little sweet potatoes to report any possible violation of the content with one click.


 The Little Red Book platform will continuously adjust and modify the community norms according to laws and regulations and community management experience. In order to maintain a good atmosphere in the community, any violation of the community norms or disrupt the community ecological order, the platform has the right to deal with the community norms.





 Hundreds of millions of users share their life experiences on the Little Red Book platform. These shares are sincere and friendly, neutral and objective, which Xiaohongshu has always cherished and proud of. The community atmosphere can not be maintained without the joint efforts of the community and all users, and need to be further created and maintained together. For this reason, in addition to the requirements of laws and regulations and public order and morals, Xiaohongshu and the users agreed to a common community code of conduct, to be observed by all, in accordance with the Convention to act, to achieve sincere sharing, friendly interaction. Also agreed with the merchants and brands, to do business in good faith, create with heart.



 Please respect originality and share real content
  When sharing and communicating on Xiaohongshu, please ensure that the materials used come from your own experience or creation. If you need to borrow, please make sure you have the right to use them. Please also ensure that all material is authentic, which is a basic prerequisite for communication. If you need to reproduce them, please obtain permission from the other party and give credit to the source.
 If you are sponsored or facilitated by businessmen in the process of sharing and creation, please declare the interests concerned
  Users will make consumption decisions based on what people share in the community, please respect and protect their right to know (and please let them do so with transparent information). Relevant benefit declarations usually don't affect your word-of-mouth, and we've observed that authors who proactively inform are more likely to receive positive feedback from their followers as long as the content they share is sincere and well-intentioned. Also, please try to be objective and neutral in your daily sharing.
 Please avoid showing off spending power far beyond the norm
  Wealth is hard to come by and remains scarce for most people. So if you have relatively more wealth, please be empathetic, actively consider others' feelings, avoid waste, and respect the laborers/service providers in the process of sharing your consumption. The Xiaohongshu community has a lot of content sharing the process and results of consumption to provide reference and advice, so "whether it is useful to others" will be an important criterion for determining the behavior of "showing off wealth". Fictionalizing and fabricating spending power far beyond that of ordinary people will also become a key target of the platform's governance.
 Please share content that has been scientifically verified
  Science is a powerful way to learn about the world and ourselves, and it has dramatically changed our daily lives. The ability of science to be reproduced by experiments and to be confirmed to be falsified makes it highly relatable in summarizing patterns and predicting trends. However, pseudoscience still hides in areas such as health advice and business promotion. If you want to share insights in these areas, make sure the content is scientific.
 Please try to avoid over-polishing, especially in areas such as beauty, dressing, and store scouting that offer advice to others
  The core reason for the popularity and long-term prosperity of the Xiaohongshu community is that there is an active group of members who are happy to provide sincere advice and help to others, and they consistently share authentic, multi-faceted content. We all love beauty, and you can embellish your notes, but remember that what you share can be used by others to make decisions at any time, so it's important that you don't mislead by embellishing your notes.
 Don't share content with excessive nudity or sexual innuendo.
  The community explicitly prohibits the posting of nudity or sexually suggestive content. If you are sharing for educational or medical purposes, or for the public good such as gender equality, please adhere to strict ethical norms and avoid content that is suggestive, provocative, or evokes undesirable associations to the greatest extent possible. Whether or not it's appropriate to talk about sex and body-related topics is judged upside down, based on whether or not the audience feels it's appropriate, which requires active responsibility on the part of the sharer.
 Please do not impersonate others
  Xiaohongshu is a UGC community with a large number of active ordinary users. We are committed to encouraging ordinary users to participate in sharing, so the community will not protect specific names, the community allows renaming, but please do not pretend to be someone else.
 Please don't easily use your influence to make accusations or post inflammatory remarks
  If you have a certain number of followers in the Xiaohongshu community, it means you have some public influence, please do not abuse this influence. If you believe that you have been unfairly treated or violated by other members of the community, please first seek help from the community's complaint channels or take legal action. Be careful about using your influence to make retorts and accusations.
 Please avoid using hyperbole, hunting, etc. to attract users to click on your posts.
  Please share content that matches the topic of the article. Using exaggerated and strange titles and covers is a kind of insincere sharing behavior and will be moderately regulated by the Little Red Book community. Sharers should not take any chances, and please continue to build up your fans through sincere sharing.
 Don't give medical and investment advice easily
  Medical treatment and investment are related to the personal health and property safety of users, and should be given or received by professionals or in a professional place for appropriate advice and guidance. Any content shared by users that relates to medical and investment topics should be prominently labeled with the words "No Medical/Investment Advice".
When sharing medical information, professionals are advised to identify their field of practice or research, share comprehensive and objective information, and refrain from publishing information that has not been tested by evidence-based medicine; when sharing medical information, users without relevant qualifications are advised to refrain from exaggerating their experience, and do not give medication/treatment advice to others at will. Do not share behavior that violates social morality, such as guiding the abuse of medicines and excessive hoarding of scarce medicines and other livelihood resources.
Everyone has a different risk tolerance, capital, mindset, cycle, and needs, so any investment advice given to others in the community is actually one-sided. Please do not give investment and financial advice lightly, and be cautious when referring to such experience sharing.
 Please respect others
  If your sharing involves others, please adhere to the principle of voluntariness and respect others' rights to privacy, likeness, and reputation;
If your sharing involves the deceased, please take the initiative to consider the dignity and privacy of the person concerned and his/her family;
If your sharing involves minors, please pay special attention to and prioritize the protection of their privacy and personal information; as parents, please refrain from sharing nude photos and videos of children;
If your sharing involves vulnerable groups, please maximize empathy for their situation and maintain their dignity.
 Please respect users and the content they share
  Respecting others and their achievements is the basic premise of human communication, please treat sincere sharing with friendly interaction. No reason can be used as an excuse for inappropriate behavior or discourtesy in interactions with others.
 Please encourage ordinary people to speak and share
  The Xiaohongshu community is still growing, and there will be an influx of more users. They come from different regions and have different social and educational backgrounds. Even though their life experiences and creative abilities may temporarily differ from those of professional creators, it doesn't mean they can't contribute good ideas. Welcoming, encouraging and accommodating newcomers and ordinary people to speak and share is the core value of the Little Red Book community.
 Please don't be stingy to express your favorites by liking, following and other behaviors!
  The Little Red Book community encourages you to clearly express your favorites and praises to the sharers, especially if what they share is useful to you.
 If a share is useful to you, or you ask for more specific advice, please clearly express your thanks!
  Every share that is useful to you has a low creative cost behind it, and the sharer must have invested a lot of time and energy. When you ask for more specific experience and advice through comments or private messages, please express your gratitude, regardless of whether the other party's reply actually answers your question. Don't be a reacher and don't treat the sharer as a tool person.
 Do not speculate on the motives of the person sharing
  Questioning or asserting a speaker's motives is the "most unethical" behavior in a discussion, and is a discussion killer. Not questioning motives is in fact "taking things personally". Motives are not facts and are difficult to prove. If you don't agree with the content, refute it by presenting facts and logic, rather than asserting the speaker's purpose or motivation. A user's motivation for sharing, at least, should not be the primary criterion by which we judge the merits of content.
 Please think differently and communicate kindly
  The Xiaohongshu community has a large number of diverse users, and it is common for people to interact with people from different backgrounds. Different users usually have different views and opinions on the same things due to the different facts they have and the different positions they are in. And, experience sharing is a common behavior in the Xiaohongshu community, which usually shows a certain degree of subjectivity and tendency, which is also the objective law of such content creation. If the content of the sharer does not match your experience or opinion, please try to restore the sharer's situation and empathize with his feelings before making comments.
 Please base your interaction on the content, in general, appearance, size and age are not necessary elements for discussion.
  Please pay attention to the content itself, and discuss and interact based on the content. The age, body shape, or other physical characteristics of the person sharing are not the basis of whether the sharing is valuable or not, nor are they a proof of experience or reliability of efficacy. We do, of course, encourage generous appreciation of a sharer's appearance and body shape without stinting on appropriate occasions.
 Tell us about content that makes you uncomfortable via the report and dislike buttons
  If content in the Community makes you feel uncomfortable, offended, or untruthful, or if you believe it may have an adverse effect on or harm others, especially minors, please be sure to tell us about it through the features provided in the Community to avoid further potential harm.
 The Platform respects and protects the creative assets of businesses and brands.
  Creativity is the crystallization of wisdom and aesthetics. Only by fully respecting and protecting creative assets can we perpetuate creativity, generate new and diversified value, bring the joy of discovery to consumers, and keep the community alive. The platform will continue to upgrade the intellectual property protection mechanism for merchants' and brands' IP, original designs, and content, so that merchants and brands can truly use their energy for innovation, and not be affected by plagiarism and other infringements that affect their creative vitality.
 Please certify your business through a professional number and operate in the community with a clear and unambiguous identity.
  Buyers and sellers are not naturally equal in terms of information, and it is difficult for consumers to have an in-depth understanding of the qualifications behind the merchant, the quality of the goods and services, etc. In order to protect consumers' rights and interests, the platform provides a professional number authentication function to verify the identity of merchants and protect consumers' right to know information such as transaction qualifications, history of transactions and evaluations. Based on the professional number system, merchants and brands can also better identify themselves to users for business behavior, and enjoy a series of tools from the platform to empower them, reduce trust costs and transaction friction, and improve business efficiency.
 Please share the goods or services you have created with your heart and soul to the community users through the content.
  In Xiaohongshu, content such as notes or live streaming is a more accurate and low-cost way to reach and connect with consumers. Hundreds of millions of users connect with Xiaohongshu through notes and other forms of content, and even niche interests, aesthetics and commodities can always accurately find like-minded "people in the same boat", while the accumulated content can also shape a better image of the business or brand, and better exposure in the community.
 Please introduce your goods and services in a truthful and objective way.
  A stable and prosperous business ecology comes from customer trust. Please take the goods or services received by the user as matching the seller's description as the standard, and standardize the introduction of your goods or services, as well as the information conveyed in the communication, without excessive whitewashing and exaggeration. At the same time, in a fair two-way exchange, bring users an experience that meets or even exceeds their expectations, and only when users return their trust and word of mouth will they be able to do so, which is the sincere advice for long-term business in the Xiaohongshu community.
 Please complete the transaction within the platform to protect the rights and interests of both buyers and sellers
  Friction and disputes in the transaction process can not be avoided, when the transaction occurs within the platform, the Little Red Book has the ability to act as a neutral third party to protect the rights and interests of both parties to the transaction and experience. At the same time, this also allows Little Red Book to better empower merchants and brands to continue to connect users and help more emerging industries and quality merchants and brands grow here. Please do not direct transactions off-site on personal pages, comments, private messages and other scenarios.



 Please seek content partnerships with creators through the Dandelion platform
  Content collaboration with creators is also a matching of supply and demand. Dandelion Platform has more comprehensive information and understanding of creators' personal style and content audience, and can give merchants and brands better cooperation matching suggestions while taking efficiency, cost and suitability into account. At the same time, the platform will ensure the authenticity and quality of the cooperation content by means of content auditing, reduce the performance risk in cooperation, and protect the interests and rights of merchants and brands. In this process, although some costs may be incurred, but can ultimately build a more healthy and mutually beneficial cooperation ecology. The platform is a co-builder and part of a healthy ecosystem, not a consumer and taker.
 Please make sure that creators' collaborative content is based on real experiences and avoid excessive interference
  Each user has their own lifestyle, aesthetic and creative style, and different ways of maintaining trust with their fans. When collaborating on content, creators help businesses and brands explore communication points, create content, deliver business value and build influence based on their own style and audience. If the content is false or inaccurate, the value of diverse content loses its foundation. As initiators, merchants and brands have the obligation to ensure that creators' content comes from real experiences by providing samples and offline experiences, etc. Please do not interfere with users' sincere expressions excessively in order to continuously generate diversified cooperative content that is convincing and recognized by consumers.
 Please undertake and adhere to social values and humanistic care in marketing behavior.
  Marketing spreads not only the product value and brand proposition of a merchant or brand, but also reflects the corporate philosophy and social responsibility behind it. Therefore, while serving the needs of consumers, please do not solicit eyeballs and clicks by rubbing the wrong way, creating gender or group antagonism, or selling anxiety, and please pay attention to the protection of minors and vulnerable groups.
 Please respect competitors
  A good business environment allows every merchant and brand to focus on long-term development. Unfair competition by framing rivals through smearing, stepping on and malicious reporting will only bring losses to both sides and ultimately consume consumers' trust. So please respect your rivals and compete fairly, and the platform will fully protect merchants and brands from malicious competition and operate in the community with peace of mind.
