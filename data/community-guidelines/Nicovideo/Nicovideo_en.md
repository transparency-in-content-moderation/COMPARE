Nico Nico Activity Guidelines
============


1\. Nico Nico is a platform where everyone can freely engage in expressive activities
---------------------------------



Nico Nico is a service that allows people to freely present content on the Internet in the form of videos, live broadcasts, bloggers, etc., and allows viewers to add their own comments to the content.

It is a place where anyone can equally present their thoughts and works, regardless of race, gender, age, organizational affiliation, or past career.

The restrictions by NicoNico on the content of expression by users will also be kept to a minimum.

We hope that by doing so, many wonderful works will be created, discussions on specific topics will deepen, and the unique culture of the Internet will further develop.

Users of NicoNico are expected to understand these ideas and to agree to all of the terms in paragraphs 1-5 of this guideline before using the service.




2\. People who are active in Nico Nico Nico respect each other's independence, and problems are resolved between the parties involved.
---------------------------------------



People who publish content on NicoNico have rights and responsibilities for that content.

And they must respect each other's rights and responsibilities, and respect each other's independence.

Therefore, if a problem arises, such as harming someone or infringing on someone's rights due to the content you have presented, the parties concerned should, in principle, resolve the problem among themselves.




3\. Freedom of expression through content is not unlimited
----------------------------



As stated in the previous section, in principle, if a problem arises due to published content, the parties concerned should resolve the problem among themselves, and while restrictions on expression by Nico Nico will be kept to a minimum, some may not be allowed to be published.

4\. Interference with the expression of others is not permitted.
----------------------



NicoNico has a truly unique and diverse commenting culture, where users share their feelings by commenting on content, expressing respect and love for the expressive person, or making a big splash with a barrage of bullets.

Comments are the most important feature of NicoNico, and NicoNico is trying to preserve this culture.

On the other hand, however, comments should not obstruct the expression of others or stifle those who express themselves.

If the comment is unwanted by the person who presented the content or the people who enjoy watching it, NicoNico may delete the following comments at its own discretion from the standpoint of protecting the freedom of expression of the contributor.



**Criminal or illegal comments**.


Example.)


* Advising of a murder or terrorist attack, indicating the date, time, place, or method of the attack.
* Notifies of the sale of illegal items such as drugs, weapons, bombs, etc.
* Soliciting prostitution or aiding and abetting.


**Comments that violate the rights of others**.

5\. Do not expect too much from NicoNico management!
-------------------------------



NicoNico will support the diverse expressive activities of its users and will establish a specialized operation system to deal with inappropriate content and comments.

However, NicoNico cannot guarantee that all of the millions of contents and comments that are posted daily will be carefully examined or judged by NicoNico management.

If we do not remove any content or comment that is offensive or inappropriate to you, it does not mean that we approve of the content.

Even if we receive a report about a certain content, we may not be able to delete it if the basis for deeming it illegal is unclear, if there is insufficient information to judge that the content is offensive to public order and morals, if we cannot confirm a report from the copyright holder, if the fact of infringement is unclear, or if it is desirable to resolve the issue between the parties concerned. In such cases, we may withhold judgment or make a judgment of "no judgment" depending on various circumstances.
