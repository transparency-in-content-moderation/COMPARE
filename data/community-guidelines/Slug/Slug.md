##### Community Guidelines


A key part of this site is the ability for members to post questions, comments, and links. As we want to ensure that this platform is inclusive and discussions lively yet productive, we would like members to consider the following guidelines. Help make this an intelligent place for discussion and it will be.
1. Remember that people come to their own truth differently.
2. Try to free your mind from personally identifying with an issue or reiterating a polical party's opinion.
3. Think of those who have different views with kindness and avoid strawmanning or dehumanizing them.
4. We welcome debate and dissent but personal attacks, persistent trolling and similar abuse will not be tolerated.
5. Avoid profanity, vulgarity, etc. Arguments have more impact if they are polite and respectful.
6. Recognise that there is a difference between criticising a politician, government, organisation, religion or belief and attacking people.
7. Keep comments as short as possible while still getting your point across.
8. Stay on topic. If you want to create a new topic thread, simply post it using the "Post" button at the top
9. If you post a link to another site, please make sure that it's relevant to the discussion.
10. Whenever possible, do a search first to see if the topic has already been posted. Feel free to comment on the original post as your comment will show up at the top of the list when sorted.
11. Don't post anything commercial. If you think there is something that the community wants to buy, send it to us first :)
12. **Most importantly, don't advocate or make threats for bodily harm to any individual or group (including hyperbole). Doing so will result in immediate suspension or removal.**


  

Please note that we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason. Obviously, we want to keep the discussion as open as possible but we have limits.

We will also remove any content that may put us in legal jeopardy, such as potentially libellous or defamatory postings, or material posted in potential breach of copyright.
