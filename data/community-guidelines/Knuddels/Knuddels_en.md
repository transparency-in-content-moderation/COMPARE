**Our Knuddels\- philosophy**
--------------------------------

In 1999, Holger, Mathias and Mirko founded Knuddels to bring people closer together. This mission is still reflected in our Community\ values today. At Knuddels, we live these three values together full of enthusiasm and are happy to pass them on.

### 1\. Human connection

We are social beings, need each other and find our true strength in the community. We are there for each other and close to each other. We laugh together, comfort each other, share experiences, encourage each other, listen to each other sympathetically, look out for each other and meet each other authentically. We are the we.

### 2\. Respect and appreciation

We welcome everyone, regardless of gender, personality, sexuality, origin, faith or background. Knuddels is open to everyone who can understand that behind every nickname is a person with feelings and a story of their own. All our members deserve to be treated with respect and appreciation, without prejudice.

### 3\. Co-create

We shape our community together. Each and every one of us is an important piece of the puzzle that makes Knuddels possible and helps us have a great time together. Whether we moderate, help, appreciate, nominate, administer, design channels, program apps and games or organize events - as moderators, newbies, team players, regulars, developers, admins, old hands and members.

We are Knuddels
-----------------

In our community, we weave a colorful web of cohesion, respect, tolerance and humanity. Every thread is an encounter, every knot a moment of connection. Knuddels thus becomes a place where we not only feel comfortable, but where we can also grow personally and build deeper connections with each other. Through Knuddels, everyone playfully finds important people for real life.

**Golden Rule**
-----------------

If you live by these values, you will follow the etiquette and terms and conditions without much thought, even if you don't know all the rules in detail. But be warned: Violations of our values, such as deliberate misuse of our services, use of bots, creation of fake accounts, deception or harassment of others, can have serious consequences. These range from a simple warning to account suspensions and legal action. Respectful interaction is the key to a positive experience in our community.

Importance and necessity of these guidelines
----------------------------------------------

The etiquette is based on these values and is the behavioral and content guideline on Knuddels. It is instrumental in maintaining an atmosphere where all members feel safe and respected. The following guidelines define our expectations for communication and interaction with each other as well as behavior towards Knuddels and its members. By adhering to these basic rules, each member can help ensure that Knuddels remains a welcoming and positive platform. Etiquette is an important tool for avoiding misunderstandings and resolving conflicts and helps us to ensure safety and respect within our community.

1\. Safety
--------------

### a) General security measures

In the interests of security, we provide a comprehensive reporting system and would like to encourage every member to report violations of our guidelines or applicable law via this system. In order to ensure the operability of the administration, care should be taken to report only actual violations and especially not to abuse the system for fun. If there is no violation, but there is still no further interest in contacting a person, other members can be ignored or blocked at any time. We also ask all members to configure the contact filter so that conversations only take place between members whose contact you are really interested in. We do not recommend changing preset contact filter settings. The receipt of pictures that can be sent via "Augenblick" must be confirmed in advance. We ask our members to only accept such photos if this is their express wish. Our community management monitors what is happening on the platform in order to identify potential security-related problems and to tackle and rectify them at source. All of these measures help to ensure a safe and respectful environment in our community.

### b) Protection of minors

Registration with and use of Knuddels is only permitted for persons aged 16 and over. By using conversation filters and manual checks by volunteers, we can identify members who are presumed not to have reached this minimum age. Re-activation is only possible through a strict verification procedure in which the minimum age must be proven. Statements or behavior that could be potentially harmful to minors will not be tolerated. The protection of underage members is our highest priority.

We work in close cooperation with the Federal Criminal Police Office to ensure that crimes against minors are brought to justice.

### c) Safe online\behavior

Safety is just as important in the online\ world as it is in real life. Particular care must be taken when disclosing personal information. Data such as your address, telephone number or bank details should never be passed on to strangers or to the public. The same applies to passwords and account information. It is also advisable to use strong and unique passwords and to change them regularly. When using our TAN\ system, security-relevant changes and processes can only be authorized by entering a code (TAN) that is sent to the cell phone number on file. Caution is also advised when making appointments in real life. Real-life meetings with contacts from the Internet should always take place in public places and at least one trusted person should be informed about the meeting.

You can find more information on the safety and protection of our members here.

2\. Behavioral guidelines - promoting positive interactions
-------------------------------------------------------------

### a) Positive interactions

We strive to create a space where everyone can make positive connections through honesty, respect and appreciation. We believe in the power of humanity and encourage all members to be authentic and accept others in their diversity. Our community is based on the principle of mutual respect, where every voice counts and every contribution contributes to the common good. We foster a culture of participation where everyone can contribute to creating a supportive and benevolent environment, free from hostility.

### b) Equal treatment

All members are committed to equal treatment and condemn racism, discrimination and prejudice in any form. We are committed to a community in which the dignity and rights of every individual are recognized and protected. Every member of our platform deserves respect and fair treatment, regardless of origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion or other characteristics. Knuddels should be a place where differences are celebrated and diversity is seen as a strength. Any post that promotes hatred, intolerance or injustice is contrary to our core values and will not be tolerated. We encourage constructive dialog, promote mutual understanding and support initiatives that strengthen diversity and inclusion.

### c) Anti-extremism

In our community, we stand together against all forms of extremism and recognize it as a serious threat to our community and society in general. All forms of hate speech, including the use of hate symbols and the denial or whitewashing of historical mass crimes, are strictly prohibited. Knuddels stands for a safe and respectful exchange. Our platform may not be used in any way for incitement to hatred, hostility and crimes of any kind, including violent extremism or terrorism. All members are committed to actively opposing extremism and promoting tolerance and acceptance.

### d) Respect

We believe that everyone has the right to interact in a safe and supportive community. Insults, provocation, harassment or bullying undermine the respect and dignity of others and will not be tolerated. We also condemn any form of interaction that seeks to demean others based on their identity or beliefs. Erotic conversations should also be conducted respectfully and exclusively consensually within the context of the conversation. The context of the respective channel and its customs as well as the overall situation must also be taken into account. Any form of pressure or non-consensual content or conversation is strictly prohibited. Sexual harassment has no place on our platform.

### e) Illegal activities

Knuddels prohibits the use of the platform for illegal activities.

  
Any

* Appointments to,
* sharing experiences about or
* promotion of

illegal activities are prohibited.

  
This includes, but is not limited to,

* the planning of criminal offenses,
* the exchange of illegal content or methods, and
* participation in activities,

that violate national or international laws.

  
We are constantly working to prevent illegal activities and cooperate closely with the relevant authorities, in particular the Federal Criminal Police Office, to ensure compliance with the law and offer intensive support in any investigations.

### f) Prohibition of advertising

Our platform does not serve as an intermediary for other sites. For this reason, third-party advertising is not permitted. This applies in particular to links or redirects to third-party providers or social\media channels as well as messengers. Requests with a purely financial purpose are also strictly prohibited.

### g) Chat language

Messages and content may be written in German or English, with German being the main language. This language policy promotes an inclusive environment in which all members can actively participate and communicate more easily, minimizing misunderstandings and communication barriers. It also ensures the ability of volunteer members to act, as even a translation program cannot provide administrative certainty.

3\. Profile\- and content guidelines
-----------------------------------

### a) Authenticity - the authenticity on Knuddels

All profile details, such as age, gender and profile photo, must be truthful when registering. This is to ensure that our members can be sure that they are really writing with the person behind the nickname. The account itself may only be used by one person. Double or multiple use of the account is not permitted. Authenticity on Knuddels is important to us.

Copyright and personal rights must be respected. No photos and content may be uploaded for which neither the copyrights exist nor the creator has granted a right of use. If there is no consent or no image right, content may not be uploaded. In this context, please refer to our photo rules.

### b) MyChannels and user apps

Every member with "Family" status or above or who has reached the corresponding Quest\ level has the option of creating their own channel (MyChannel) via the Desktop\ app (StApp).  It is also possible to develop and publish your own user apps. In a way, this gives users the opportunity to create their own world. Be it with a MyChannel for certain topics or a channel in which you make your first, specially developed game available. Our Developer\Terms and Conditions apply to the latter.

Public MyChannels with a constant member presence receive the status "Important". Channel names and \-content may not be politically extreme or violate the rights of others. The operator of the MyChannel is responsible for moderation and provides a sufficient number of MyChannel\ moderators (MCM). MyChannels must also be correctly categorized. This applies in particular to erotic\channels that are inaccessible to minors. Violations of our MyChannel\ guidelines can lead to the blocking or deletion of the MyChannel.

### c) Inappropriate and illegal content

The individual design of the profile, a MyChannel or your own user app offers extensive opportunities for self-realization. However, content that glorifies violence, is pornographic, offensive or extremist, whether explicit or ambiguous, will not be tolerated and will be sanctioned accordingly. Furthermore, any user-generated content is not used for the advertising of other websites or messengers.  

4\. Volunteering - Democratic approach
-----------------------------------------------------

Since its foundation, Knuddels has been a lively community whose members volunteer and organize themselves through democratic processes. Every member has the opportunity to become involved as an admin or channel moderator (CM) from the status of "regular". These positions are filled through regular elections, which gives every member the chance to actively participate in shaping our platform. In the course of volunteering, there is then the opportunity to become a trusted admin (VA) or channel leader (CLT). In addition, there are teams specializing in different subject areas, such as youth protection, profile, anti-extremism and many more, for which you can apply and are selected by the team leaders of the teams depending on your suitability.

These volunteer positions and teams form an important pillar in maintaining our values and the safety of the community. Through this structure, we promote responsibility, participation, development and positive community interaction. Within the framework of our election rules and in the event of a breach of our Community\Guidelines, exclusion from volunteer positions may occur in case of doubt.

5\. Virtual goods
-------------------

### a) What are virtual goods?

Virtual goods are purely digital objects that can be used within Knuddels. These include, but are not limited to, items such as our digital currency (Knuddel), superboosts, keys, roses or smileys, including special abilities gained through features. Virtual goods can be purchased on Knuddels for real money as well as gained through activity or volunteering.

### b) Sale of virtual goods

The sale of virtual goods for real money is strictly forbidden to members on Knuddels and also outside the platform. This rule protects our members from the financial risks of fraud and unauthorized transactions as well as legal complications that can arise from trading virtual items. However, it is possible to exchange virtual goods on the platform for other virtual goods, lend them and sell them for Knuddel. We also make our members aware of the dangers of fraud and false promises.

### c) Farming

Farming with second nicks is prohibited on Knuddels. The creation and use of accounts, mainly to collect benefits such as goodies in game channels or Knuddel from quests without triggering real interactions, is not tolerated. Accounts that are used purely for monetary gain or are considered to be mass-produced goods will be blocked. Second nicks should be used regularly, personalized and used for real communication. This rule is intended to help distinguish legitimate use from abusive farming, whereby we always consider the overall context.

6\. Enforcement philosophy
----------------------------

### a) Methods

It is always possible to report violations and anomalies to the channel moderators and admins via the reporting system. Manual checks of various kinds are also carried out to ensure that our guidelines are adhered to. For example, all photos are checked for violations by the Profile\ team. Our administrative members are present in the chat at all times and intervene directly in case of doubt.

In addition, automated protection mechanisms such as filters and AI applications are used to prevent offensive statements in public and private messages, in the profile and when choosing a nickname, or to directly remove pornographic, violent or disturbing images or similar (Google Vision).

### b) Measures

Violations of guidelines can be punished by warnings, removal (images, readme, groups) and by the temporary or permanent blocking of accounts, channels, profile content or images. In the event of serious violations, we also reserve the right to impose personal, account-wide blocks.

If a report is found to be relevant under criminal law, it will be re-examined and, if necessary, reported by Knuddels employees. In addition to the reporting of planned or past, reportable criminal offenses, as part of our cooperation with the BKA, we report in particular the search, offering and distribution of child\ or youth pornographic images, past or planned criminal offenses against minors (including cybergrooming and sexual harassment of minors) and similar criminal offenses.

### c) Complaints procedure

Knuddels offers the option of having sanctions reviewed as part of a complaints procedure. The chat bubble or E\-Mail community@knuddels.de are also available for contact via our Help\-Center.

### d) Acting outside the community

Your actions outside the community can be taken into account in the context of sanctions or volunteer work.

Against extremism \- For tolerance and acceptanceExtremism, tolerance, acceptance, etiquette, chat behavior, community, anti-extremism, AET, discrimination, respect, nationalities

Posted by Knuddelsteam over a week ago updatedWhen boundaries are crossed
=================================

Jokes always stop being funny when they attack or discriminate against someone, to name just two examples. Extremism has many faces, most of which are political.

 

The Knuddels\ community is committed to educating you about this. Extremism has no place on Knuddels and is also prohibited by the terms and conditions.

 

Background information
===========

Political extremism is defined as any kind of politically motivated action aimed at achieving political goals through (verbal) violence. GTC point 6: "Content and statements" refers to this topic, among others.  

Article 3 (3\) of the Basic Law states:

 

"No one shall be disadvantaged or favored because of his sex, descent, race, language, homeland and origin, faith, religious or political views. No one shall be discriminated against on the grounds of disability."

 

Political extremism
=======================

Right-wing extremism:
------------------

The ideology of right-wing extremists states that ethnic affiliation to a nation or race is a more important factor than other values, such as human rights. Their aim is to merge the state and the people into a single entity ("ideology of the national community"), which in reality leaves no room for democracy and amounts to a dictatorship. The anti-constitutional, mostly inhuman ideology is expressed in right-wing extremist, particularly xenophobic crimes, which are mostly directed against minorities simply because of their ethnicity.

 

If you observe such behavior, you should always show civil courage and take a clear protective stance towards the person being discriminated against.

 

Left-wing extremism:
-----------------

Left-wing extremists are declared opponents of the state\ and social order. Depending on their ideological\-political orientation, they want to establish a socialist/communist system (classless society without private property) or a "society free of domination" (anarchy). Left-wing extremists also try to find a way to achieve their political goals, including through (physical) violence.

 

Left-wing extremism is therefore not directed against specific groups of people, but against the state order or democracy.

 

Foreign extremism / Islamism:
----------------------------------

People in (and from) other countries also form extremist or terrorist organizations. Probably the most widespread in this area is so-called Islamism. Only a small proportion of Muslims are Islamists. Islamists believe they are called upon to enforce the "Islamic order" by force. They refer to the call to "jihad" (actually: effort, inner struggle, also: "holy war") contained in the Koran, which they, in contrast to other Muslims, regard as a sacred duty to wage incessant war against all "enemies" of Islam.

 

In the case of Islamism, the ideology is primarily directed against people of a different faith.

 

Based on this, the following actions in particular are prohibited on Knuddels:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Discrimination, insults and provocation of other persons and groups of persons based on their religion, political views, sexual orientation, nationality,...
* Advertising for extremist organizations, music groups, parties,...
* targeted dissemination of the above-mentioned ideologies
* Spreading symbols, numerical codes, song lyrics, etc. that are based on the above-mentioned ideologies or want to convey them
Above all, you should of course take a clear stand against extremism and protect victims. You should always report extremism in the chat to the administration, e.g. by using the reporting system.

 

If you are unsure or would like more detailed information, the Anti\-Extremism\ team will be happy to help.

 

The anti-extremism\ team
=========================

The Antiextremism\-Team (AET) was founded in 2005 and deals with political extremism and glorification of violence in chat. The AET's tasks include education, prevention and protection, training of HZMs and CMs and rapid action in the event of violations in chat.

 

What actually is extremism?
-------------------------------

Extremism refers to ideologies that are on the extreme fringes of the political spectrum. Extremists are declared opponents of the constitution who use violence to enforce their anti-democratic stance. There are several different forms of extremism, an overview of which can be found here:

 

* Right-wing extremism
* Left-wing extremism
* Foreign extremism
* Islamism or Islamist terrorism
* Racism/xenophobia
* Discrimination/degradation in any form
All of these forms rely on violence to achieve their goals. The content of these ideologies not only violates the General Terms and Conditions of Knuddels, but is also on the edge of legality.

 

How can I recognize extremism?
------------------------------

Extremism manifests itself in various ways. For example, through language codes, slogans, symbols and songs.

 

Additional information
-------------------------

In the AET\-FAQ in the forum you also have the opportunity to find information or ask questions to which the Antiextremism\-Team will respond.

 

Team members of the AET
----------------------

Of course, the team members of the Antiextremism\-team are also available to answer your questions. You can find this information by entering the chat command /h Antiextremismus\-team.

 

Note:
------

* Knuddels takes an active stance against extremism of any kind.
* If you have any questions, please contact the Anti\-Extremism\-Team.


Dealing with insults and provocation in the Knuddels\ communityInsults, provocation, insulting, provoking, protection, safety,

Posted by Knuddelsteam Updated over a week agoInsults and provocations can tarnish the Knuddels chat\experience and affect the well-being of members. We want to make sure that everyone in our community feels respected and protected. That's why it's important to know how to react appropriately to such situations and protect yourself.

 

🤗 Respectful treatment is the be-all and end-all
======================================

Respect is the foundation of our community. Insults and provocations violate this basic rule. Here are some tips on how you and other members can treat each other with respect:

* Remain polite and friendly, even if you disagree.
* Avoid getting personal or attacking other members.
* Remember that behind every nickname is a real person with feelings.
🛑 How you can respond to insults
===========================================

It is important to respond appropriately to insults to prevent the situation from escalating. Here are some steps you can take:

* **Stay calm:** Try not to react impulsively. Take a deep breath and think carefully about your response.
* **Confront the person:** Politely but firmly say that you find their comments offensive and ask them to stop.
* **Block or ignore:** If the insults continue, use the block or ignore functions to protect yourself and end the situation.
* **Report the incident:** If the abuse is serious or repeated, report the incident using our reporting system. We will take appropriate action.
 

🔇 Don't feed the trolls: Ignore as a legitimate response
=========================================================

Sometimes the best response to insults and provocations is to simply ignore them. By not responding, you prevent the situation from escalating and don't give the offender a platform for their behavior. Here are some reasons why ignoring can be an effective strategy:

* Ignoring can help de-escalate the situation and get the offender to stop their behavior.
* By not responding to provocations, you show the offender that their behavior will not receive any attention or reaction from you.
* Ignoring allows you to focus on positive interactions with other members and continue to enjoy the chat\experience.
Remember that it's okay to not respond and simply ignore insults. Sometimes silence is the best response to maintain a respectful and positive chat room for all members.

 

👀 How to recognize our reporting system

📸 Protection when sending pictures
-------------------------

It's exciting to receive pictures from other members, but your safety comes first. Here are some tips for dealing with pictures in chats:

* **Consent before receiving pictures:** You can only receive pictures from others if you have explicitly allowed this.

Dealing with bullying in the Knuddels communityBullying, bullies, cyberbullying, bullying\prevention, online\harassment
Cyberbullying

Posted by Knuddelsteam Updated over a week ago

At Knuddels, we place great importance on our community being positive and respectful. Unfortunately, bullying can occur in any online\community. That's why it's important that our members know how to deal with it and what support is available.

🤕 What is bullying?
==================

Bullying is when someone deliberately and repeatedly tries to harm a person physically, socially or psychologically. It can happen online or offline, and it is carried out by a person or group abusing their power over others. Bullying can come in different forms, such as mean messages, threatening images, or other inappropriate behaviors. It is important to understand that bullying is any repeated behavior that is intended to hurt, threaten or harass someone, and it can have severe consequences.

On Knuddels, if you see someone stalking people in channels, grouping people together to annoy someone or abusing admin authority to demonstrate power over others, this is also bullying.

 

 

🆘 How you can deal with bullying on Knuddels
================================================

If you see bullying or are even affected by it yourself, please report it immediately. Go to our reporting system, select the nickname and enter all the important information. Explain why you think the behavior violates our rules or terms and conditions. Our moderators and administrators will review the incident and take appropriate action.

 

 

👀 How to recognize our reporting system
===================================

You can always recognize our reporting system by the exclamation mark. You will find this in the following places, among others:

* In private conversations next to the nickname of the person you are talking to
* In the profile next to the nickname of the person who owns the profile
* In the channels at the top, next to the channel name
The icon that takes you to the reporting system always looks like this:

 

💡 Did you know?
====================

* Bullying affects different people: those who bully, those who are bullied and even those who witness it.
* Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people to be bullied by people they know, such as people from school, coworkers or friends
* Bullying can occur anywhere, be it in schools, online, on the playground or at work.
* Interestingly, even people who are bullied themselves can sometimes bully others. Those who bully are often trying to regain lost power or control in another part of their lives.
 

🤝 Dealing with bullying
====================

* **Protect against unwanted contact:** Check your contact filter to ensure that only people who are within your personal comfort zone can write to you.
** **Ignore and block:** Ignore the harassing person and block them to prevent further contact.
* **Report to Knuddels:** Use the Report\ feature to inform us of hurtful, threatening or harassing behavior. Our moderators and administrators are trained to respond appropriately.
* Talk to friends or other members about how you're feeling. It often helps to get support from others.

👀 Don't look away!
==================

Bystanders who observe bullying play a crucial role in stopping such behavior. If you see someone being treated badly, you can help by raising your voice and advocating for respect and kindness.

It's important not to look away, but to take action. Together we can create a great community where everyone feels safe and respected.

Be a part of the change and stand up for positive coexistence! 💪

Posted by Knuddelsteam Updated over a week ago🤔 What are unlawful violations?
==================================

Unlawful violations are actions that not only violate our T&Cs or the Community\Knigge, but also the law. Such violations may include, for example, the following

* Disseminating illegal content (such as child pornography, incitement to hatred, ...)
* Incitement to violence or hate speech
* Fraud or phishing
* Harassment or stalking
These offenses pose a danger to society and may have to be prosecuted.

⚖️ How do I distinguish between unlawful and "normal" violations?
=============================================================

Violations that are not illegal are behaviors that violate the internal guidelines of our platform, but are not necessarily considered illegal. Examples of this could be

* Spamming
* Use of offensive language
* Harassment of other members that does not yet reach the level of criminal relevance
Such violations are reported via the reporting system, dealt with internally by our volunteer teams and can lead to warnings, account restrictions or, in extreme cases, exclusion from the platform.

🗯 How do I report unlawful infringements?
=======================================

If you come across illegal behavior on Knuddels, it is important that you report this behavior immediately. Such a report is also made via our reporting system.

**Selection of the checkbox for illegal violations:** In the reporting system you will find a special checkbox that you can select if an illegal violation is detected.

 

**Provide additional information:** After selecting the checkbox, please provide all relevant information about the incident. The more detailed your information is, the more effectively we can respond.

 

**Investigation and forwarding:** Crimes against minors will be reported to the Federal Criminal Police Office after investigation by employees. All other illegal offenses are reported to either the state criminal investigation offices or the local police, depending on the type of offense.

☝️ What else is important to note?
------------------------------------

**Confidentiality:** The report will be treated confidentially. Your identity will not be disclosed to third parties and especially not to the accused.

 

**Your own safety:** Do not attempt to intervene in the situation yourself, especially if it involves serious unlawful acts.

 

**No vigilante justice:** Please refrain from any form of vigilante justice. Leave the matter to the appropriate authorities.

Illegal violations are serious actions that can have criminal consequences and are not only against the rules of our platform, but also against the law. Reporting such incidents helps to keep our community safe and combat unlawful behavior. We thank you for your support and vigilance.



  In addition to the terms and conditions, the following rules apply to the use of the photo gallery.

**The following applies to all profile photos**
-----------------------------

Your chatting on Knuddels will be more exciting if you know who you are writing with. Therefore, show yourself in such a way that others can recognize you. This means that your face must be completely recognizable to other members. A photo in which, for example, your cell phone or your scarf cover part of your face is not permitted as a profile photo. You can present photos of your pets, cars, favorite heroes, etc. in your album.  
  
Remember that the chat platform is also a public space. So only show yourself as you would normally do in public.

**The following also applies to all photos**
-----------------------------

We restrict the depiction of nudity or sexual acts, as some members of our community find this type of content offensive. We also always remove images with sexual and pornographic content.  
  
For example, we restrict the depiction of female breasts if the nipples are visible. Full nudity is not permitted for either gender, which means that primary genitals must not be visible.  
  
The secondary genitals, especially the buttocks, may not be completely naked. Photos of paintings, sculptures and other forms of art that show naked people or figures are permitted.  
  
Photos of warlike depictions and self-harming behavior as well as pictures on rails are not tolerated.  
  
We reserve the right to make different decisions in individual cases.  
  
Photos showing children under the age of 14 are not permitted.

**For adolescents applies additionally**
-----------------------------------

Smoking and drinking alcohol is prohibited by law for young people. Therefore, do not upload any photos in which you do this.  
  
Topless photos, especially bellyless photos, are not permitted. Otherwise you may quickly be approached in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable. Photos that emphasize the sexuality of the person in the photo are not permitted and will be deleted.
