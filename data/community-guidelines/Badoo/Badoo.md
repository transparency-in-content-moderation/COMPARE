Badoo Community Guidelines
==========================

 Badoo is a space to make kind connections in a safe, inclusive, and respectful way. In order to foster healthy and equitable relationships, we hold our members accountable for the way they treat each other.

 
Our Community Guidelines help keep our members safe. They make it clear what content and conduct is not acceptable (on our platform and off).

  ### Profile Guidelines

 * Age. You need to be at least 18 years old to join Badoo. Creating a profile that intentionally misrepresents you as being under the age of 18 is not allowed. We reserve the right to ask for your ID to verify your age, and we’ll block you from the platform if you’re underage.


 * Profile Photos. We want your profile to celebrate your authentic self! That’s why we require at least one of your profile photos to depict only you and to clearly show your full face. We do not permit:

 * Profile photos that are heavily distorted or contain exaggerated or unnatural digital effects to the point where it cannot be clearly determined that you’re the person in the photos
* Any overlaid symbols, icons, frames, or stickers that aren’t from Badoo on your profile photos
* Memes or photos with only — or primarily — text as a profile photo
* Profile photos of children on their own
* Profile photos with unclothed children


 * Username. Members are allowed to use initials, abbreviations, contracted or shortened versions of their name, nicknames, full names, and middle names. Members do not have to use their legal name or full name, but usernames should be an authentic representation of the name you use in everyday life. We do not permit:

 * Any words or phrases that violate our Community Guidelines
* Using the name of a celebrity or fictional character
* Words or characters (other than a valid name) including descriptive words, symbols (e.g. $, \*, @,), emojis, numbers, or punctuation

 
### Content and Conduct Guidelines

 #### Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity

 We don’t permit nude, sexually explicit, or sexually vulgar profile content. We also don’t allow the commercial exchange of any romantic or sexual activity, content, or services, including attempts to sell, advertise, or buy adult sexual content. Learn more.


#### Bullying and Abusive Conduct

 Our community is for creating kind connections. We don’t allow content or behaviour that makes any individual or group feel harassed, bullied, or targeted. This includes belittling, insulting, or intimidating behaviour; making unsolicited comments about someone’s appearance; engaging in emotional abuse; blackmail; repeated unwanted contact; or wishing, encouraging, or praising acts of violence. Learn more.

 #### Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse

 We have a zero tolerance policy towards any form of child sexual exploitation and abuse. We don’t allow content that sexualises or endangers children, real or fictional (e.g. anime, media, text, illustrations, or digital images). This includes any visual depictions or discussions of sexually explicit conduct involving a child. For the purposes of this policy, a child is anyone under the age of 18\. It’s prohibited to upload, store, produce, share, or entice anyone to share child sexual abuse material, even if the intent is to express outrage or raise awareness about this issue. Learn more.


#### Commercial and Promotional Activity

Our platform is not a marketplace. We don’t allow using Badoo for unsolicited commercial or promotional purposes. Learn more.

 #### Controlled Goods and Substances

 We don’t allow members to use our platforms to buy, sell, supply, distribute, or directly facilitate the purchase, sale, supply, or distribution of illegal drugs and/or the misuse of controlled goods and substances. This includes: e\-cigarettes, marijuana, drug paraphernalia, or the misuse of legal substances like prescription drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Learn more.


#### Dangerous Organisations and Individuals

We don’t permit organisations or individuals that proclaim, glorify, condone, or are known to support a violent, dangerous, or terrorist\-based mission to have a presence on Badoo. Learn more


#### Inauthentic Profiles

Badoo celebrates authenticity, and we expect all our members to represent themselves accurately on their profile. We don’t allow impersonation or misrepresentation on our platform. This includes catfishing (i.e. creating an online persona that isn’t you) or falsely stating facts about yourself (including name, gender, age, and permanent location). Learn more.

 #### Misinformation

We prohibit the sharing of demonstrably false or substantially misleading content that’s likely to cause serious harm or negatively impact individual or public safety. This includes content that directly contradicts information and guidance from leading and reputable global health organisations and public health authorities, false or misleading information on any civic process, and dangerous and unproven conspiracy\-type theories. Learn more.


#### Physical and Sexual Violence

We don’t tolerate any content, imagery, or behaviour that commits or threatens credible acts of physical or sexual violence. This includes physical stalking, using our platform to assist, facilitate or support exploitation or human trafficking, and sexual assault of any kind, which we define as unwanted physical contact or attempted physical contact that is sexual in nature. Learn more.

 #### Scams and Theft

Badoo prohibits any scam or theft activity intended to defraud or manipulate members out of financial or material resources. This includes requesting or seeking financial support, lying about your intentions for financial gain, or faking romantic intentions to deceive members out of financial or material resources. Learn more.

 #### Sexual Harassment

We do not tolerate sexual harassment. We consider sexual harassment to be any non\-physical, unwanted, and unwelcome sexual behaviours between members. This includes cyberflashing (i.e. sharing unsolicited sexually explicit images), in\-person indecent exposure, sharing or threatening to share sexual or intimate images without the consent of the person involved or depicted, sending unwanted sexual comments or images, and fetishisation. Learn more.


#### Spam

We do not permit any kind of unwanted or irrelevant content sent in bulk or high frequency. This includes sharing misleading or misdirecting links, creating an excessive number of accounts causing disruption to other members, or having multiple active profiles on our platform to engage in unwanted interactions. Learn more.

 #### Suicide and Self\-Injury Promotion

We care deeply about our members and understand that some may struggle with mental health, self\-injury, suicidal thoughts, substance use, or eating disorders. While we do allow members to share personal experiences with these issues in a safe way, we don’t allow any content that depicts, promotes, glorifies, or assists in activities that could lead to suicide, self\-injury, or disordered eating or body image. Learn more.


#### Violent and Graphic Content

We don’t permit violent, graphic, or gory content. This includes descriptions of violence in usernames or profile content, photos containing real or realistic\-appearing blood, bodily fluids, or injury, or images depicting guns of any kind (except on a uniformed member of law enforcement or military personnel). Learn more.

 
### Platform Manipulation

 We prioritise fostering a community built on genuine connections, so any attempts to artificially influence connections, matching, conversations, or engagement through the use of automation or scripting is strictly prohibited.

 
### Safety Reporting

 Safety is a top priority at Badoo. We use a combination of human moderators and automated systems to monitor and review Badoo accounts and interactions for content that may be against our Community Guidelines, against our Terms and Conditions, or otherwise harmful.

 
Our members play a critical role in the safety of Badoo by reporting content or behavior that may violate our Community Guidelines. If anything happens that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, we highly encourage you to Unmatch with – or Block \& Report – the member. See this article for more info on what happens when you report something to Badoo.

 
However, please consider that disagreeing with or disliking a member or their content is not necessarily a reason to report them. We may take action against a member if we’e found them to be intentionally creating false or inappropriate reports against other members solely based on their protected attributes. This includes reporting transgender or nonbinary members for no reason other than their gender identity or expression or repeatedly sending false reports of bad behaviour.

 
### Enforcement Philosophy

 All members must comply with the platform rules described and referenced in our Community Guidelines. If you behave in a way that goes against Badoo’s Community Guidelines, values, or otherwise act in any way we believe to be potentially harmful to Badoo or its members, we may take a range of actions on your account. When determining the penalty for violating our community guidelines, we consider a number of factors.

 For example, we may:

 * Remove the content
* Issue a warning
* Ban the offending member from some or all Bumble Inc. apps


 When necessary, we also may cooperate with law enforcement to assist in potential criminal investigations related to member conduct.

  Your treatment towards others outside of the Badoo app can also result in action against your account. If we’re made aware of harm between members on dates, meetups with friends, via text message or direct messaging platforms, or relevant alleged criminal or harmful conduct committed in your past or outside of Badoo, we may take action as if it happened on our platform.

 
If you believe we’ve made a mistake in taking action on your account or content, you can always contact us here.

Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity
--------------------------------

  We know that some conversations on Badoo may discuss and involve sex, intimacy, romance, and attraction. Members using Badoo **are allowed to:**

 * State their romantic or sexual intentions on their profiles, as long as it’s legal and not overly obscene, crude, or otherwise in violation of these Community Guidelines.
* Use their private messages on the platform as a place to engage in sexual conversations with matches, as long as everything is consensual (that means welcomed by both parties), honest, and law abiding. (See also  Sexual Harassment).


  We value self\-expression and diversity within our community and encourage our members to share profile photos that celebrate bodies of all shapes and sizes. Photos of members wearing athleticwear are permitted whether indoors or outdoors. Members are permitted to wear swimwear in profile photos if taken outdoors.

 
However, **we don’t allow profile photos or the sharing of links on profiles that depict:**

 * People where the following is shown, even if covered or partially covered by emojis, hair or transparent clothing: 
	+ Genitals or pubic regions
	+ Bare buttocks
	+ Women’s nipples and areolas


* Visible explicit outlines of genitals
* People in lingerie or underwear
* Sexual acts of any kind, even if not explicitly visible
* Digitally\-created or drawn imagery (e.g. cartoons, memes, anime, drawings) that depicts any of the above. This imagery doesn’t necessarily have to include human beings


 We also don’t allow Badoo to be used for any commercial exchange of sexual or romantic acts of any kind. This includes, but isn’t limited to, the following:

 * Any attempts to sell, advertise, or buy sexual acts in exchange for money or something of value (e.g. sex work, escort services)
* Any attempts to sell, advertise, or buy adult sexual content (e.g. pornography, sexual live streams/webcamming). This includes using the platform to promote or re\-route members to adult content websites
* Any behaviour seeking or offering a romantic or sexual arrangement in exchange for money, financial support, or gifts (e.g. seeking a “sugar daddy” or “sugar baby”)


 We recognise that our members use Badoo with different intentions and may want to make this transparent on their profile. We encourage members to be open about what they are looking for; however, we do not permit overly obscene sexual content in public profiles or usernames such as:

 * Explicit, vulgar, or unnecessary detail about kinks
* Descriptions of sexual acts
* Sexually explicit or vulgar jokes


 Learn about our enforcement philosophy against the guidelines on this page. And, if you believe we’ve made a mistake in taking action on your account or content, you can always contact us here.

  

### Bullying \& Abusive Content

 Our community is all about creating kind connections. We aim to create an experience which is free from behaviour that makes any individual or group feel harassed, bullied, or targeted.

 Members may not:

 * Engage in any bullying, belittling, insulting, mocking, trolling, intimidating, dehumanising, or degrading behaviour
* Make harmful unsolicited comments about someone’s body or appearance (e.g.
body shaming)
* Wish, encourage, or praise acts of violence, or threatening acts of violence that would result in non\-serious bodily injury
* Engage in emotional abuse and/or manipulation
* Repeat unwanted online contact of any kind
* Blame, shame, or target someone based on their status as a survivor/victim of sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, or domestic abuse
* Release a person’s private contact information, photos, or other personally identifying information without their consent
* Blackmail a member to reveal embarrassing, compromising or otherwise private information (not including sexual or intimate content)
* Not show up to an in\-person meet up despite clear plans agreed by both parties
* Create a profile with malicious intent to publish defamatory content about a person
* Share content that is disrespectful toward victims, survivors, or families impacted by suicide, self\-injury, or eating disorders


 This includes content about public figures. Members are permitted to express their criticism of public figures, but we will not tolerate abusive conduct in any form.

  Learn about our enforcement philosophy against the guidelines on this page. And, if you believe we’ve made a mistake in taking action on your account or content, you can always contact us here.

  

### Child Sexual Exploitation \& Abuse

 We don’t allow content that sexualises or endangers children, real or fictional (e.g. anime, digital images, media, text, illustrations). This includes any visual depictions, sharing third party links, or discussions of sexually explicit conduct involving a child. It’s prohibited to upload, store, produce, share, or entice anyone to share child sexual abuse material (CSAM), even if the intent is to express outrage or raise awareness about this issue.

We understand that members might want to talk about and share images of their children with their connections. Any discussions about children must remain appropriate, relevant, and lawful. In addition, if you decide to include photos of children in your profile, they must be completely clothed and they cannot appear alone in the image. This includes any photos from your childhood.

We don’t allow profile photos of babies’, toddlers’ or children’s genitalia or buttocks even when they’re covered or partially covered by emojis.

Any violation of this policy will result in a member being removed from Badoo and reported to the authorities. In compliance with U.S. law, if we become aware of apparent child sexual exploitation, child grooming, or child abuse, we will report it to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC may make the report available to relevant local and global law enforcement authorities.

We understand that members might discuss or share content about a dangerous organisation or individual for purposes of awareness, education, or condemnation.

Otherwise, it may lead to your content being removed, action being taken against your account, and/or reporting to appropriate authorities.

### Inauthentic Profiles

  Badoo celebrates authenticity, and we expect all our members to represent themselves accurately on their profile.

  Members are allowed to use initials, abbreviations, contracted/shortened versions of their name or middle name as long as these names are a variation of their authentic name.

 We don’t allow members to use our platforms to buy, sell, supply, distribute or directly facilitate the purchase, sale, supply or distribution of illegal drugs and/or the misuse of controlled goods and substances.

  Controlled goods and substances include, but aren’t limited to: e\-cigarettes, marijuana, drug paraphernalia, or the misuse of legal substances like prescription drugs, tobacco, or alcohol.

In private messages or group chats, we may also allow imagery of drugs if shared explicitly for educational or health\-related purposes. However, it’s important to make your intentions clear in sharing this content, or it may be removed and/or action may be taken against your account.

  Learn about our enforcement philosophy against the guidelines on this page. And, if you believe we’ve made a mistake in taking action on your account or content, you can always contact us here.

  

### Misinformation

  Misinformation is false or misleading content that can quickly escalate into serious risks to individuals, communities, and institutions. Because of this, we don’t allow the sharing of demonstrably false or substantially misleading content that’s likely to cause serious harm or negatively impact individual or public safety.

 
This includes, but isn’t limited to:

 * Content that directly contradicts information and guidance from leading and reputable global health organisations and public health authorities that could result in injury or harm to the public, for example about COVID\-19, monkeypox, or any other communicable disease or illness
* Any proposed cures for COVID\-19 or any other illnesses not widely recognised as effective by leading and reputable global health organisations and public health authorities
* Demonstrably false or substantially misleading information regarding abortion care that is likely to cause serious harm. This does not prohibit members from voicing personal opinions or policy perspectives on the issue, as long as the information doesn’t intend to harm, mislead, or contradict leading and reputable public health authorities and the discussion remains respectful and doesn’t violate our Bullying and Abusive Conduct policy
* False claims or misleading information on any civic process (e.g. elections, voting systems, census, referendums, etc.)
* Dangerous and unproven conspiracy\-type theories that may lead to individual or public safety concerns
* Content from or links to third party sites that are known to produce or contain misinformation
* Content that denies the concept or severity of hate crimes or historical events (See Identity\-Based Hate)
* Any type of misinformation relating to political affairs aiming to influence political outcomes, or manipulate historical fact.
* Content that has been intentionally manipulated or taken out of context to spread false or misleading information.

 
Sharing any of the above content may lead to your content being removed and/or action being taken against your account.

 Learn about our enforcement philosophy against the guidelines on this page. And, if you believe we’ve made a mistake in taking action on your account or content, you can always contact us here.

  

### Physical and Sexual Violence

 We don’t tolerate any content, imagery or behavior that commits or threatens credible acts of physical or sexual violence.

  This includes, but isn’t limited to:

 * Threatening or committing sexual assault of any kind, which we define as any unwanted physical contact or attempted physical contact that is sexual in nature. These behaviors can range from:
	+ Unwanted sexual touching or kissing of any body part, or attempts to do so
	+ The unwanted removal of another’s clothes
	+ Stealthing (i.e. the non\-consensual removal of barrier contraceptives)
	+ Non\-consensual sexual penetration or attempts to do so, which include but aren’t limited to: rape, non\-consensual oral sex, sexual acts while one party is unconscious or unable to consent to sexual activity, or sexual acts induced by coercion or a substance


* Expressing credible threats of violence that would result in serious bodily injury or death
* Physical stalking (i.e. surveilling or showing up at someone’s location in order to intimidate or initiate unwanted contact)
* Using our platform to facilitate exploitation or human trafficking. We define human trafficking as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of adults through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit.” (UN Office on Drugs and Crime)

 
We strongly encourage our members to report this type of behaviour if it occurs on the platform, in person between members, or elsewhere outside of the Badoo platform. Our specialised safety team can provide external resources for support. Since this behaviour may also be criminal in nature, reporting to a local law enforcement authority may also be an option. If we become aware of any of the above conduct, we may take action against offending member accounts, and may also cooperate with law enforcement in any resulting criminal investigations.

  For more information about how you can remain safe while meeting a match in\-person, you can visit the Badoo Help Centre.

### Scams and Theft

 Badoo strictly prohibits any scam or theft activity intended to defraud or manipulate members out of financial or material resources. We define scams as members making seemingly dishonest or false representations that aim to manipulate or defraud victims for financial gain or cause them loss.

 * Asking other members for financial support in the form of money, loans, investments, or donations
* Lying about your intentions for financial gain

* Committing in\-person indecent exposure (i.e. unwanted flashing on a date)

* Making unwanted sexual comments, questions, and advancements, including sexualised comments about someone’s body
* Fetishising a member without their consent
* Sending unwanted sexualised imagery including memes, animations, drawings, etc., as well as unwanted pornographic imagery or links

### Suicide and Self\-Injury Promotion


We care deeply about our members and understand that some may struggle with mental health, self\-injury, suicidal thoughts, substance use, or eating disorders. While we do permit members to share their personal experiences with these issues in a safe way, we do not allow any content that depicts, promotes, glorifies, or assists in activities that could lead to suicide, self\-injury, or disordered eating or body image.


We don’t allow:


* Encouraging, promoting, glorifying, or providing instructions for suicide or self\-injury

* Dangerous amateur acts or viral “challenges” that can cause serious bodily harm



In response to content that may describe a suicidal or self\-injurious plan, intent, or thought, we may remove the content and send the member local supportive resources such as suicide prevention hotlines. If we have reason to believe a member is an imminent danger to themselves, we may contact local emergency authorities for intervention, which could include emergency services providing a welfare visit.
