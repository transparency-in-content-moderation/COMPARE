Guidelines \& Legalese/Community Guidelines
====================

Our number one priority is to create a fun and safe place for kinksters, like you and I, to call home here on the interwebs.


To make sure FetLife is a fun and safe place, we wrote the following list of general community guidelines we would like everyone to respect.


Just remember that your participation on FetLife is always subject to our Terms of Use.


Enjoy Yourself
--------------


No, seriously, enjoy yourself! If this is your first time joining a kinky community we know it can be scary at first. We recommend you go at a pace that you feel most comfortable. Join groups that catch your attention, read what other people have to say, participate in discussions and strike up conversations with people that pique your interest.


Be Open\-Minded and Non\-Judgemental
------------------------------------


People often say to us how they love the fact that FetLife's community is so open\-minded and non\-judgemental, and we are proud of that.


Please help us make sure FetLife stays this way. There is no place on here for any “my kink is ok but yours is not” attitude.


No Pictures or Videos of Kids Allowed
-------------------------------------


The community has spoken and they do not want to see any pictures or videos of people under the age of 18 on FetLife. It is not illegal to have innocent pictures or videos of kids on sites like FetLife but the community prefers we keep a 18\+ rule.


You Must Be At Least 18 Years Old
---------------------------------


To join FetLife you need to be at least 18 years old. Each person matures at a different speed and you might feel you are ready to join a site like FetLife when you are 17, but you need to wait until your 18th birthday to join FetLife.


Think Twice Before You Hit “Say It!”
------------------------------------


You can remove any content on your profile at any time. It is your profile after all!


You should think twice though before you start or comment on any discussions. To maintain the integrity of discussions we don't remove the original post or any comments unless they break one of our guidelines or our Terms of Use.


Only Post Pictures and Videos You Own or Have The Rights to Post
----------------------------------------------------------------


You should only upload pictures and videos which you have taken or which you were given permission to post on FetLife.


Has someone taken one of your pictures or videos and uploaded it to FetLife without your permission? Not cool, not cool at all! But, we can take them down for you. Check out our Terms of Use for more information on how to report copyright infringements.


Private Conversations Should Be Kept Private
--------------------------------------------


Private conversations between two members should stay private, unless of course, the two people who were having the conversation both agree to it being posted publicly. It is just common courtesy.


Don't Out Anyone
----------------


Each person on FetLife is comfortable with different pieces of their personal information being revealed. Some people don't mind you using their full real name and others don't want you to even use their first name. Please make a conscious effort to respect each person's comfort level.


Also, to protect members of the community, we don't allow phone numbers or addresses to be posted publicly on FetLife unless they are for a business, organization or event.


Take Everything You Read With A Grain of Salt
---------------------------------------------


FetLife is for entertainment, informational, and educational purposes only. What people post is not verified by anyone for its accuracy. What you read on FetLife should not be construed as actual, professional advice. You should always consult a qualified professional.


Spam and Cross\-Posting
-----------------------


Who likes spam here please raise your hand? You over there in the back of the class… are you serious? I didn't think so.


Since nobody likes spam other than spammers, we promise to protect you from it to the best of our ability. This includes cross\-posting. We will not tolerate anyone posting the same message more than 3 times a day anywhere publicly on FetLife.


Someone Breaks One Of Our Community Guidelines
----------------------------------------------


We don't scan FetLife other than for spam or scammers. So if you come across something that goes against our community guidelines, it is probably because nobody reported it. Please don't hesitate to report anything that does not look kosher to report@fetlife.com and one of our Caretakers will investigate.


More detailed information about what happens when a guideline is broken can be found in the guideline pages in our content guideline section.


1% Of Your Action Belongs To Us
-------------------------------


We have no clue how we are going to claim this but we want 1% of the action you are getting from this site. Yeah, you heard me right. While we are working our asses off to grow FetLife you are getting action and we want 1% of it, damn it! We think it is only fair. ;\-)


Got Questions or Suggestions?
-----------------------------


If you ever need clarification on any part of the community guidelines or have a question, suggestion, a bit of feedback, or a problem with the site, please feel free to contact us at support@fetlife.com.


Changes to the Community Guidelines
-----------------------------------


Like FetLife itself, the Community Guidelines will evolve over time, so make sure to check back often for updates.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines
==================

On FetLife, it is very important to us that *you feel free to be yourself and let your freak flag fly!*


Our guidelines aren't black and white nor do we think it's healthy for them to be. For every guideline there are tens of thousands of edge cases that we will have to review on a case\-by\-case basis and act on them by taking into consideration multiple factors including context, how the average person might interpret something, etc.


If at any point you're ever concerned something you're posting might be misconstrued the wrong way then please make the extra effort to assure things are as clear as possible.


If you have any questions about our guidelines don't hesitate to email support@fetlife.com.

NOTE: If you are in a picture or video that you do not consent to be on FetLife, you can have it removed through our Person in Picture / Video process.


### Who can report a potential violation of this guideline?


Anyone who appears in the picture or video. We need to hear directly from the person to confirm that they did not consent to the picture or video being posted. 


### How do I report a potential violation of this guideline?

### What happens if someone violates this guideline?


When we determine that someone has posted revenge porn to FetLife, we delete the content in question and execute a 90 day preservation request on the profile that posted the revenge porn. This way all evidence is maintained for 90 days in case the victim of the revenge porn decides to press charges.


After removing the content and preserving the account, we review the person’s profile. If we determine that the person joined FetLife with the sole purpose of distributing revenge porn, we lock the member out and put their profile in the delete queue.


If the person who posted it is an active member of the FetLife community, we give them a minimum of a one week timeout and only allow them back onto FetLife after they agree to never again post revenge porn. 


If the member posts revenge porn again, they will be locked out of their profile and their profile will be added to the delete queue for permanent deletion.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Privacy Concerns/Person in Picture / Video

Who can report a violation of this guideline?
---------------------------------------------


Anyone who appears in the picture or video. We do not act on third\-party reports under this guideline.


What happens if someone violates this guideline?
------------------------------------------------


When a report is made, a FetLife team member reviews the report. If we can’t verify the reporter is in the picture or video using what we find on their profile, we may request a confirmation photo.


When there is sufficient information that the content may be in violation of the guideline, the picture or video is removed. We then inform the member that we removed the content because someone who appears in the picture or video no longer consents to it being posted. 


A member receives a warning for posting content they did not have permission to post unless they can provide proof that they did have prior permission. Repeat violations will result in escalating suspensions from FetLife.

Once they remove the infringing content and we confirm that it’s been removed, their account is unlocked, and their timeout starts. 


Timeouts for posting another member's content off\-site start at one week and double each time to a maximum of four weeks.

Our primary goal is to get the content taken down. If we ban the member who posted the content off\-site they have no incentive to take the content down. 


**Q. If they refuse to take the content down do we have any other tools at our disposal?**


If they do not respond to our email and/or refuse to take down the infringing content, our Legal Department will send a DMCA takedown request on behalf of the member whose content is posted off\-site.

If a sock puppet account is used to break another guideline then we will instead apply the longest of the two applicable time out lengths.


For each subsequent violation, the member's timeout increases in length, up to a maximum of a two\-week timeout. Any current secondary accounts are deleted, and they also risk losing their main FetLife account.

#### FAQ


**What do you mean by legal liability?**


In many places, including Canada, where FetLife is headquartered, someone can be held liable for "publishing" defamatory matter.


There's a three\-part test for defamation, sometimes referred to as libel, for written material:


* Is it defamatory? Defamation is communication that hurts a person's reputation. Making a criminal accusation is, by definition, defamatory.
* Does it refer to the person? A Canadian court held in a case that a FetLife account name was sufficient to identify an individual.
* Was it "published"? If FetLife has knowledge of the accusation, for example by it being reported to us, the material has been considered "published".


Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Privacy Concerns/FLRO
====

FetLife Restraining Orders (FLRO) are FetLife’s take on restraining orders. When an FLRO is put in place, we ask that all members that are part of the FLRO no longer speak directly or indirectly to or about one another from the time the FLRO is issued. 


FLROs are only handed out in extraordinary circumstances and only when nothing else has worked. 


FLROs are between people and not accounts. FLROs remain in place unless one of the people involved in the FLRO is permanently banned from the site.


We do not issue FLROs in cases where we believe the person who is requesting the FLRO is doing so to try to silence a victim. 


How do I request an FLRO?
-------------------------


To request an FLRO, a member will need to:


* Have blocked the person for several uninterrupted weeks
* Provide evidence of specific and direct malicious behavior that is continuing despite the block
	+ *Examples include but are not limited to harassment in groups, posting about content they are blocked from seeing, ongoing spotting, etc.*
* Contact trust@fetlife.com


What is an FLRO Violation?
--------------------------


When an FLRO is issued, we request that all parties involved remove any posts on FetLife about one another. If the Caretakers come across any, we will remove them without notification or a warning if they are from the past. Any posts made after the FLRO is issued will be removed with notification and may be subject to time\-out.


What is in violation of this guideline?
---------------------------------------


Examples include, but are not limited to:


* Members directly or indirectly speaking to or about someone they have an FLRO with
* Members sending unsolicited private messages regarding someone they have an FLRO with
* Members requesting to be contacted by a private message regarding someone they have an FLRO with
* Members using a secondary account to spy on or investigate someone with whom they have an FLRO with


**What is not in violation of this guideline?**
-----------------------------------------------


Examples include:


* Member stating that they cannot speak about their FLRO or anyone involved


**How do I report a potential FLRO Violation?**
-----------------------------------------------


You can report potential FLRO violations as follows:


1. Visit the page with the potentially offensive material
2. Select "...", “More,” or “Options,” then select “Report”
3. Select "Content Not Permitted"
4. Select "Next"
5. Add any additional information that you think is important
6. Select "Report"


For more information, you can refer to Submitting a Report. 


**Who can report a potential violation of this guideline?**
-----------------------------------------------------------


Anyone aware of an existing FLRO and believes there may be a potential violation of the order.


**What happens if someone violates this guideline?**
----------------------------------------------------


If we believe the content violates the guideline, the content is removed, and the person is timed out for a week.


If the person continues to violate their FLRO, each subsequent timeout they receive increases in length, and the person risks losing their account.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Safety Concerns/Registered Sex Offender
=======================

A Registered Sex Offender (RSO) convicted of a violent or nonconsensual sexual offense is not permitted to have an account on FetLife.


Most countries outside the US don’t have public RSO lists. In those cases, we consider a conviction of a violent or nonconsensual sexual offense to be equivalent. 


### What is in violation of this guideline?


Under this guideline, anyone who we can confirm is:


* (Inside U.S.) a RSO convicted of a violent or nonconsensual offense; or
* (Outside U.S.) convicted of a violent or nonconsensual offense


is not permitted to have an account on FetLife.


To confirm someone is a registered sex offender and/or has been found guilty of a violent or nonconsensual offense, we need:


* Proof of the member being on a sex offender registry or convicted of a crime that would place them on a RSO list:
	+ Link to public RSO listing (US);
	+ Link to court documents; or
	+ Link to news article (only in places where there is no public RSO registry)
* Clear and obvious links between the member in question and proof provided; *ex. matching pictures, personal information*


### What is not in violation of this guideline?


The following is not in violation of this guideline:


* Cases where we can not find an adequate link between the provided proof and the account in question. A case is reopened when more evidence is provided.
* Someone who has been charged with a crime that would cause them to be added to a RSO list but who has not yet been convicted. In these cases, we suspend their profile until there is a verdict in the case. We then evaluate the profile accordingly.


### How do I report a potential violation of this guideline?


You can report a potential registered sex offender as follows:


### On Desktop:


1. Visit the person’s profile
2. Select "report"
3. Select "Other reason..."
4. Select "Next"
5. Provide:
	* Link to public RSO listing; or
	* Link to news article; or
	* Link to court documents
6. Select "Report"


### On Mobile:


1. Visit the person's profile
2. Select "..."
3. Select "Report"
4. Select "Other reason..."
5. Select "Next"
6. Provide:
	* Link to public RSO listing; or
	* Link to news article; or
	* Link to court documents
7. Select "Report"


### By Email: (only for non\-members)


1. Send an email to legal@fetlife.com
2. Include a link to the member’s profile or the member’s full nickname
3. Provide:
	* Link to public RSO listing; or
	* Link to news article; or
	* Link to (or an attachment of) court documents


For more general information on reporting, please visit: Submitting a Report.


### Who can report a potential violation of this guideline?


Anyone who can provide adequate proof that the account in question is run by a sex offender who is convicted of a violent or non\-consensual offense.


### What happens if someone violates this guideline?


When an on\-site report is made that includes adequate proof, and there is a clear and obvious link between the account and the evidence provided, then the account is suspended and the report is escalated.


After the report has been escalated, a member of the legal team reviews the report. Once a member of the legal team confirms that the member is in violation of the guideline, the account is put in the delete queue, the removed member is notified, and information about them is added to our internal RSO list.


When reporting directly to legal@fetlife.com, it follows a similar process as on\-site reports, except the account is not suspended until the legal team has fully reviewed it. This is because on\-site caretakers do not have access to the legal inbox to do an initial review.


If a RSO creates a new account after we removed their initial account, and they live in an area where mandatory reporting of internet identifiers is required, a member of our legal team will report them to the proper authorities.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Safety Concerns/Threat of Violence
==================

Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Safety Concerns/Eating Disorders

For the safety and well being of our members, we do not allow public content that promotes or encourages Anorexia, Bulimia, or any other type of eating disorder. Alternatively, We do allow people to share their own experiences and journeys around self\-image, healthy eating, and body acceptance.


### What is Anorexia and Bulimia?


Anorexia is an eating disorder where someone avoids food while maintaining an unhealthy focus on their weight. People with Anorexia can become dangerously underweight and experience intense body dysmorphia.


Bulimia is an eating disorder where someone has recurring episodes of eating a very large amount of food, followed by vomiting or the use of laxatives to prevent weight gain.

Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Keyword Spam
============

People sometimes add a list of related keywords to a group description, writing, picture etc. to make sure that the content in question appears in the appropriate search results.


In some cases, people sometimes get a bit overzealous and add hundreds of keywords, oftentimes unrelated keywords, to increase the visibility of their group, writing, picture, etc.


As a result, members often find themselves scratching their head wondering why certain unrelated pieces of content are appearing in search results. Which, makes it harder for people to find what they are looking for.


Hence, if someone has added many unrelated keywords just to boost visibility, we remove all keywords.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Friend \& Following Limits
==========================

Why are there limitations in place?
-----------------------------------


In order to ensure general site reliability and performance of the main activity feed, we’ve added a few limits around following and friending.


What are the following limits?
------------------------------


* We do NOT limit the total number of followers you can have
* Every member can follow up to 400 members every 24 hours
* Every member can follow at least 5,000 members in total, while verified members can follow at least 10,000 members
* Following limits increase based on the number of followers you have by a ratio of 5 to 1\. For example, if you are not verified and have 1,500 followers, you can have a maximum of 7,500 following (1,500 \* 5\).


What happens if someone reaches their following limit?
------------------------------------------------------


If someone reaches the following limit they:


* Will still be able to follow people who follow them
* Will still automatically follow people when they accept a friend request
* Won’t automatically follow someone to whom they send a friend request BUT after the other member has accepted the friend request, they can go and follow them manually


What are the friending limits?
------------------------------


* Any account created before August 16, 2022 can friend up to 2,500 members
* Any account created after August 16, 2022 can friend up to 1,000 members
* Verified profiles, regardless of when their account was created, can friend up to 5,000 members


What happens if someone reaches their friending limit?

What can I do when I’ve hit my friending limit?
-----------------------------------------------


Apart from manually going through your friends list, there's a one\-time option to convert all of your friends to followers by emailing support@fetlife.com.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Groups
======

### What is the criteria needed to create a Group?


**"See a Need, Fill a Need, Start a Group"**: 
Have a new idea for a group? Can't find a group that speaks to you? Want to start a group to promote your business, event, or organization? Then just do it already. Start a new group.


*For more information on running your own group, read our Group Leader Guidelines.*


### Why did my group get removed?


Examples of not a group include but are not limited to:


* Groups created as a personal ad for one person *(e.g. to find someone to hook up with)*
* Groups created to spot other members
* Groups created to advertise a subscription or sales *(e.g. OnlyFans, Snapchat, etc.)*
* Groups created to advertise a service *(e.g: I give the best massages in town!)*


Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Group Ownership
===============

### Limits on Group Ownership


To increase diversity, prevent group collection, and limit the power of any one individual, we restrict the number of groups that any one person can own to twenty groups.


Even if someone has more than one profile, they can only own up to twenty groups amongst all of their profiles.


This guideline is not retroactive. If you notice a member owning more than twenty groups, it's most likely because they owned them before this rule went into effect.


This guideline applies to group ownership and NOT group leaders and/or moderators.


### Group Collectors


Profiles created for the sole purpose of collecting groups are removed from FetLife to give them the opportunity for others to become more active in their communities.


Potential group collector profiles are reviewed on a case\-by\-case basis.



Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Events
======

### What criteria is needed to list an event?


An event listed in our events section needs to:


* Occur at a specific date and time *(e.g. Jan 1st from 5pm\-7pm)*
* Happen at a particular location (in\-person, virtual, or both)
* Be open to more than just a couple of people at a time


If an event does not have all of the above, it's most likely not an event and the event section is probably not the best place to post it.


### Why did my event get removed?


Examples of not an event include but are not limited to: 


**Not at a Specific Date/Time**


* All week event looking for people for something
* By appointment only within the scheduled time frame


**Personal Ad** 


* Looking for two people for a threesome
* Looking for a third to join us
* Looking for one person to hook up with
* Looking for someone to attend an event with
* Offering free massages


**Business Ad**


* Advertisements for one on one paid\-for sessions
* Advertisement promoting online services
* Event created to solicit followers of a group on or off\-site
* Professional photo/modeling shoots
* Offering pay massages, professional or not
* Casting call for porn shoot *(e.g. auditions)*
* Looking for talent *(e.g. people who want to be cam models)*


**Other**


* Event created to get people to join an off\-site group
* Test events


### Only One Event Listing per Event \& No Recycling of Event Listings


We only allow one event listing per unique event. Recurring events (ex. monthly munches, yearly conferences, etc.) need to have a separate listing per event.


If more than one listing is created for a specific event, we remove all but one listing.


If an event listing is recycled by moving forward the date/time of the event listing, the event will be removed without notice.


If an event organizer, organization, etc. continues to create multiple listings for the same event, or recycle previous event listings, they risk the following:


* Having all of their event listings removed
* Losing the ability to promote any future events on FetLife


Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Commercial Profiles
===================

In order to strike a healthy balance between promotional and social content on FetLife, we mark certain profiles as commercial.


We also do this to give each member the opportunity to curate their own experience.


### What is considered a Commercial Profile?


Profiles are considered commercial when they include references to selling or promoting. Examples include, but are not limited to:


* Online services *(i.e. pay\-per\-view, subscriptions, camming, etc.)*
* Virtual or physical goods *(i.e. custom videos, toys, clothing, etc.)*


### What is not considered a Commercial Profile?


Examples include:


* Events *(e.g. munches, parties, etc.)*
* Small craft commissions *(e.g. leatherworking, etc.)*
* Rehoming of previously owned items *(e.g. selling used flogger)*


### What does it mean when a profile is marked as commercial?


* Any member can choose to see or not see commercial profiles in the following places: (note: commercial profiles are visible by default)
	+ Kinky \& Popular
	+ Friends \& Following
	+ Fresh \& Pervy
	+ Stuff you love
* Profiles marked as commercial are not shown in the recommendations section
* When pre\-moderation for commercial profiles is enabled in a group, group posts by commercial profiles need to be approved by a group leader before the post is visible to everyone


### How do I know if my profile is marked as commercial?


You can check if you are marked as a Commercial Profile at any time by:


* Viewing your Account settings
* If your profile is marked as a commercial profile, you will see a notification underneath 2FA. If you don’t see anything, your profile is not marked as commercial.

Guidelines \& Legalese/Content Guidelines/Content Restrictions/Copyright
=========

You must have copyright permission for everything you post to FetLife. If you do not have copyright permission for the content, what you post is in violation of this guideline.


*NOTE: If you are in the picture or video you want to be removed, we recommend you follow the “Person in Picture / Video” guideline and process instead. It’s quicker and safer.* 


### What is in violation of this guideline?


Examples include, but are not limited to:


* Picture you found on the internet and copied without permission (not explicitly public domain)
* Copying a complete article and sharing it without permission (quoting parts is fine)
* Reposting an adult\-oriented picture or video without permission from a professional porn site


### What is not in violation of this guideline?


Content is not in violation when you have the “Intellectual Property” rights to post the content. This can be because:


1. You own the copyright to the content; *ex. you took the picture, original work*
2. The copyright owner has given you permission to post the content to FetLife
3. Content falls under “fair use”; i.e. has to meet ALL of the following factors:
	* purpose and character of work,
	* nature of work,
	* amount of work used compared to copyrighted work, and
	* effect of use on potential market for work;
4. Content is in the public domain; or
5. Content has a Creative Commons license, or similar.


### Who can report a violation of this guideline?


Anyone who owns the intellectual property of the content in question can report the content.


### How do I report a violation of this guideline?


You can report material that is potentially in violation of this guideline as follows:


### On Desktop and Mobile:


1. Visit the content
2. Select “options”
3. Select “report”
4. Select “I’m the copyright holder and want this \[picture/video] taken down.”
5. Fill out the corresponding form
6. Select “Report it”


### For non\-members:


If you own the content’s copyright, fill out the copyright infringement form at: https://fetlife.com/dmca\-takedown\-request


For more general information on reporting, please visit: Submitting a Report.


### What happens if someone violates this guideline?


A FetLife team member reviews the report. Copyright infringement reports are legal documents, so they must be completed accurately. We may contact the reporter for extra information when needed.


If the form / report has been filled out correctly:


1. We remove the content
2. We contact the member who posted the content


The reported member has the right to counter the DMCA. If FetLife receives a Counter\-DMCA:


* the DMCA and Counter\-DMCA reports are exchanged between the two parties,
* the parties will have to resolve it in court, and
* FetLife will restore the removed content in 7 days, unless we receive a court order against restoring the content


In cases where a member repeatedly violates this guideline, additional consequences will follow. This may include escalating suspensions from FetLife and/or removal of image galleries.
