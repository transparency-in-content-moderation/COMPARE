Behance Community Guidelines
----------------------------

Behance is a platform for creative professionals around the world to showcase their own work and to discover the creative work of others through three key features: Search (Discover), Live, and Jobs. These Behance Community Guidelines (“Guidelines”) are based on the Adobe Content Policies and govern your use of Behance to maintain an engaging and trustworthy community that fosters creativity across the platform, and are incorporate by reference into the Adobe’s Terms of Use.

Unless otherwise noted in the Guidelines, the same rules apply to all content on Behance. If you come across content that violates these Guidelines, please follow the instructions in the 'Report Abuse' section below. We take these to heart and hope that you'll do the same as well.

### 1\. Be Respectful and Safe

Behance is the leading online platform to showcase and discover creative work. To protect our users and maintain the high quality of content across the platform we don’t allow abusive or illegal content or behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

* Spam or posts related to the sale of non\-creative goods or services
* Fraud or scams
* Pornographic material and explicit nudity
* Harassment and threats
* Hateful or highly offensive content that attacks or dehumanizes a group based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, serious disease or disability, gender, age, or sexual orientation
* Graphic violence or gore
* The promotion, glorification, or threats of violence
* Illegal activities or goods
* Self\-harm or the promotion of self\-harm
* Depictions of nude minors or minors in a sexual manner
* Promotion of terrorism or violent extremism
* Dissemination of misleading, fraudulent, or deceptive content that could lead to real\-world harm
* Personal or private information of others (like full name, home address, phone number, email address, government issued IDs, or anything else that would let someone locate or contact you in the real world))

Please note that we may report any material exploiting minors to the National Center of Missing \& Exploited Children (NCMEC) CyberTipline.

#### Adult Content

Behance is all about helping creative people get exposure for their work, and so we offer an adult content filter (the “Adult Wall”) that allows qualifying projects to be available to as broad an audience as possible. Many countries, schools, and companies will block websites without this feature.

Projects should go behind the Adult Wall if they contain adult content (this includes nudity, profanity, violence or any other material unsuitable for a younger audience, a global audience or people at work). To do this, go into the Settings for a specific project and select “This project contains adult content” under the “Content” heading. Content behind the Adult Wall is available only to registered Behance users who are over 18 and who live in countries where adult content is legal (for more on this topic, view the Helpcenter page about Adult Content on Behance).

#### Public and Shared Content

The Adult Wall is only available to projects currently. Profile images and banner images, “Work in Progress” images, livestreams, jobs, comments, messages, Behance Creator Subscriptions, and other interactions on Behance must be appropriate for an audience of all ages and geographies and should **not** contain adult content.

### 2\. Be Supportive

We value artistic expression, but we ask that you keep your comments, private messages, and other communications constructive and respectful. We don't tolerate abusive, vulgar or insulting comments and messages.

### 3\. Be Authentic

The Behance community is for people to bring their authentic selves and to publicly share one’s own creative work. We disable accounts that engage in behavior that undermines the authenticity of our community, including but not limited to, the following deceptive or harmful behaviors:

* Using fake, misleading, or inaccurate information in your profile
* Impersonating other people or entities
* Falsely attributing someone’s work
* Using automated or scripting processes (such as bulk or automated uploading of content through a script)
* Engaging in schemes or third\-party services to boost account engagement (artificially increasing the number of appreciations, views, or other metrics)

Broadcasting or uploading other people’s work as your own is copyright infringement and is not tolerated. If you aren’t sure whether your use of someone else’s content or trademark in your work is legal, you can talk to an attorney or consult publicly available reference materials at the following:

* U.S. Copyright Office
* U.S. Patent \& Trademark Office
* Lumen

If you want to report the misuse of your own creative work or your own trademark by one of our users, you can do that here: Reporting Infringement on Adobe’s Network. If you have a contract or other dispute with Behance user about content they have uploaded to our site, please resolve the issue directly with the user. We can't moderate contract, employment, or other disputes between our users and the public.

### 4\. Additional Guidelines

In addition to all the guidelines above, certain features within Behance require you to follow additional guidelines.

#### Livestreaming

* You must be 16 years old to livestream on Behance Live.
* Streamers are not allowed to broadcast streams that promote dangerous, reckless, or criminal behavior (e.g., driving while streaming, playing with a firearm).
* Streams are broadcasted around the world, so please be mindful of what you display and be aware of the following:
	+ What you are streaming on your desktop and browser (e.g., browser history, browser tabs)
	+ What can be seen in the surrounding environment (e.g., artwork, personal information, people who may not want to be streamed)
	+ What you are wearing or displaying on your body (e.g., no nudity allowed, see\-through shirts, profanity on clothing)

* Use, copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, make derivative works of, publicly perform, and publicly display any and all visual materials you choose to share during the livestream.

#### Behance Paid Offerings

Behance paid offerings allow Creators to make additional artistic content available to paying users with Creator Subscriptions Freelance and Creative Services, and digital assets. This includes receiving one\-time payments for digital assets and Freelance and Creative Services, or recurring payments from subscribers in return for access to exclusive projects, livestreams and assets. Paid offerings cannot be used:

* To fund non\-activity (for example, don't engage in spammy behavior and only agree to stop in exchange for subscriptions).
* To crowdfund or fundraise for any goods or non\-creative services.

If you violate any of the above, your ability to offer paid offerings may get suspended, along with your subscriptions.

* A resume/CV
* Any materials seeking employment or to promote oneself
* Jobs that point to specific work contests or other opportunities that solicit spec work
* A job description that discriminates based on protected characteristics such as: race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, serious disease or disability, gender, age, or sexual orientation (where legally permissible, we may allow descriptions that express a preference for members of certain historically disadvantaged groups in hiring in such jurisdictions)

 Guide: Adult Content on Behance
 
 
 Updated 4 years ago 



**Mature Content Basics**
=========================


Behance is all about helping creative people get exposure for their work, and our **Mature Content Wall** filter is in this spirit as well. Many countries, schools and companies block web sites that don't offer safe browsing. So, by offering and enforcing this feature, we keep your work available to as broad of an audience as possible.


Content behind the Mature Content Wall is available only to registered Behance users who are over 18 and who live in countries where adult content is legal. We do not display mature content to anyone using the Image Search. To learn more about our rules, please visit our Community Guidelines.


### **How will it affect browsing?**


When browsing Behance, if you come upon a project that is marked **Mature,** you’ll need to:


* Login, if you aren't already
* Turn OFF safe browsing in order to view the project (and other adult projects). If you click **Yes**, this setting will be saved.


If you'd ever like to adjust your **Safe Browsing** setting, visit your Account Settings and check or uncheck the **Block Mature Content in the Behance Gallery** option under **Account Information**. 



**Mark Your Project Mature**
============================


To mark your project adult**:**


1. Navigate to your **Project's Editor**
2. Click **Settings**
3. Click the **Basic Info** tab
4. Check the **This project contains adult content** option.


**\*Note:** Marking a project as "Adult Content" will only apply to the single project.
