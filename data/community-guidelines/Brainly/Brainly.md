### Treat one another with kindness and respect


As part of the Brainly community, you play an important part of creating and maintaining an environment that is safe and welcoming for all. Always treat others with kindness and respect, and always let us know when you or another user might need extra kindness.








### Help others and strive for deeper understanding


Brainly is all about helping each other learn more by staying curious and always striving for deeper understanding. When helping, do your best to explain things in a way that others can understand. When other members help you, always thank them and rate their work.

### Kind


Words can hurt even if they’re not said out loud. Never post mean or hurtful things about another member, taunt them, or talk about them behind their back. Unkind words or actions directed at another community member will not be tolerated.








### Family friendly


Members of our community range in age, so we keep the content on the site squeaky clean! Sharing sexual content or asking someone to engage in sexual behaviors is not allowed.








### Peaceful


We want everyone to feel safe on Brainly. You should never threaten one another or do anything to intimidate or scare another member.








### Respectful


This is an educational environment, and we do not allow swear or curse words on the site. If you wouldn’t say it to your grandparents, don’t say it here!








### Decent


We do not allow inappropriate usernames, profile photos, or other content. In this case, “inappropriate content” includes (but isn’t limited to) adult or sexual content, content that includes profanity, drug or alcohol use, self\-harm, violence, or harassment of any kind.








### Honest


Plagiarism is not allowed—not on quizzes, tests, homework, assessments, or any other kind of assignment. Copying answers from another source, even if you provide the original link, is not allowed on Brainly.








### Helpful


All information you post here should be helpful, appropriate, and related to learning. You should only post information that you are confident is true. Never misguide others by posting an answer you know isn’t correct. If you’re ever unsure about your answer, be sure to check it with a trustworthy source.








### Original


Posting of spam content is not allowed. This includes posting the same question or answer repeatedly, posting unwanted or promotional content, and posting spam links of any kind.
