Community Rules
=================

VKontakte is a platform where millions of users share news and creativity, communicate and express themselves.

Join groups, develop your business or start a personal blog. Hold contests, organize events, find like-minded people - there are countless opportunities for you in communities. And to make you and other users of the platform feel as comfortable as possible, follow the rules below.

What's changed?
---------------

* Restrictions on the number of advertising posts per day have been lifted, and the ban on advertising in pinned posts has been lifted. Advertising in stories is now also allowed, and the "**Services**" section is now open for community pricing.
* Restrictions on changing topics have been relaxed: now you can change to any topic, as long as it is not on the list of banned topics.
* The rules for contests and promotions have become simpler: now the condition for participation in the contest can be subscription to the community, mailing list and notifications at the same time. It is also possible to ask to tag one friend (no more than one mention from one user per contest).

Questionable and banned content
----------------------------------

### Banned Content

There are certain restrictions on **published content**. This is primarily information that is prohibited not only by the site's rules, but also by Russian law and international regulations. Such violations include not only the obvious ones (for example, paid offers of intimate services), but also the remote sale of tobacco products. If you are not sure whether it is legal to post content, you should consult a lawyer.

### Blocking at the request of copyright holders

The community is blocked **for infringement of third party rights** (at the request of copyright holders).

The community can be blocked **for infringement of third party rights** at the request of right holders in the following cases:

1\. When group leaders sell certain goods of famous brands. The fact is that many goods, services, company names and even just words are registered as trademarks. The owner of the trademark has the exclusive right to use it to sell their goods or services.

**Important:** we carefully check all the documents provided by the right holder. If you have permission to use the trademark, in case of problematic situations, please contact the right holder directly or contact **Support** VKontakte.

**2\.** When community leaders pretend to be the **official representation** of a particular organization. Users who are interested in a certain company or institution are interested in receiving **actual and reliable** information. Therefore, a "fake" community may be blocked upon official request by representatives of the organization itself.

### Possible blocking by court and RCN decision

VKontakte is under **Russian jurisdiction** and complies with the laws of all countries where our products are available. Therefore, for example, we have no right to ignore the official demands of **Roskomnadzor**.

If Roskomnadzor considers certain content to be prohibited, information about the community goes into a special register, and we receive a **blocking request**, which we are obliged to fulfill within the timeframe established by law. In this case, communities are blocked permanently, and the only solution to this issue may be your appeal to Roskomnadzor to find a compromise. We do not act as an intermediary in communication with government authorities.

You can contact Roskomnadzor representatives by e-mail: **zapret\-info@rkn.gov.ru**. Please note: in the letter, you must include not only the short address (the subdomain name of your choice), but also the community's numeric ID.

**Important**: once a community is blocked, it is removed from the above-mentioned registry. However, this does not mean that the community can be unblocked and does not cancel the fact that there is banned content. The blocking can be lifted only upon an official appeal from Roskomnadzor to VKontakte with a withdrawal of the request. We have no right to take into account any other documents, including the department's responses to your e-mail.

### Unconfirmed charitable donations

Communities hosting charitable fundraisers are required to comply with the requirements described in the FAQ. Remember, **thankfulness** is not only a warm word to those who help bring you closer to an important goal, but also a **responsibility** to those who help.

Prohibited Services and Community Development Methods
-----------------------------------------------

### How to promote your community

You can find new subscribers in different ways. For example, without budgets at all: hold contests or create interesting content and get into recommendations with it. Another option - paid promotion with the help of targeted advertising. Read more here: vk.com/@authors\-kak\-privlech\-auditoriu

Growing a community without breaking the rules is an important and responsible task for every community leader. Share with your team a list of prohibited promotion methods. These include:

- Spam

- Bot pages

- Spoofing

- Violations of contests and promotions

- Changing topics to one of the prohibited ones

- Off-topic mailings of invitations

### Spam

Spamming is the sending of advertising or other information using tools that are not intended for advertising. For example, spamming via friend requests, private messages, comments**.** is prohibited.

### Bot\-pages

It is forbidden to create or purchase additional accounts to **spam** in any way. Such profiles are considered bot pages and will be blocked.

### Spoofing

Spoofing is the artificial inflating of community activity through the use of bots, hacked users, malware, or social exchanges. Social exchanges are external sites that organize users to join communities for a small fee.

The use of spoofing can result in the community being blocked **forever**.

### Changing the theme to one of the banned themes

You can choose any new topic, as long as it is not on the banned list. However, be aware of your audience - you need to prepare them for the change, or many of them may leave your community because the content is different. To ensure that the change went smoothly, and you retain the loyalty of members of the publisher, announce the news in advance. This way, subscribers won't have to wonder where an unfamiliar community appeared in their feed.

**Shift to the following topics is prohibited:**

1. **Business**, **Commerce**.
2. **Politics**.
3. **Groups of organizations**, including public organizations.
4. **Pornography**.
5. **Competitive communities**, which consist entirely of giving out gifts, stickers and other valuables for joining, reposting, inviting friends to the same group and similar tasks. The prizes themselves are usually not given out, and as soon as there are a lot of participants, the theme of the community changes to another one. Changing back **from the contest** theme to **any other** theme is also **forbidden**.
6. **Selling votes**. There is only one way to buy votes: buy them in your profile settings.
7. **Pseudo-administration of the site**. Attempts to pass off the community as an official representation of the administration are prohibited - such actions mislead users.
8. **Shocking Content**. This is material that displays violence or cruelty with the intent to shock or disgust the user.
9. Other topics that violate **rules** and **legislation of the Russian Federation.** Communities that violate the laws of other countries may be blocked for viewing on the territory of these countries at the request of their state authorities.
10. Communities created for the purpose of **deception** or **misleading**.

Off-topic invitations
-----------------------------------

Event managers may **invite** members of a community that is listed as an organizer to the community. For example, official musician groups can send out invitations to concerts to their subscribers, and universities can send out invitations to reunions.

Providing the service of sending invitations for third-party events is **inviting**. It, like **invitation mailings** for recruitment purposes, is considered spam. Mentions of inwaiting in community price lists can also lead to blocking.

Contests and promotions
----------------

When running contests and promotions in your community, please follow the rules to avoid being blocked.

It is forbidden to use conditions that artificially **increase activity** such as "Likes" or number of community members. This is stipulated in **6\.3\.6**, **6\.3\.16**.

### General provisions for all types of contests and promotions

- Contests may not be run **without a pre-designated prize**. Every prize claimed must be drawn.

- **Must post the results of the promotion within the stated timeframe**. If there is no winner or the contest entry is deleted before the results are finalized, the community may be locked. We recommend that you always include the date of the results, as well as a link to the winner's profile or their first and last name.

- A community leader** cannot be the winner of a contest held in their community, except for creative giveaways where the winner is chosen by voting.

### Allowed Contest Terms and Conditions

* **Creative contests.** For example: come up with the best poem, draw the most beautiful graffiti, guess the riddle before anyone else.
* **Competitions with conditions from the list:**
	+ **Like** the contest entry;
	+ **Share the contest entry** on your page or in stories;
	+ **Tag one friend** (no more than one mention per user per contest)**;**
	+ **Leave a comment** under the contest entry;
	+ **Subscribe to the community** where the contest entry was published, to its **subscription**, to **notifications** about new posts in it, suggest the community in **recommendations;**
	+ **Subscribe to one sponsor**, its **subscription** or **notifications;**
		- Starting from 18/01/2023, we are running an experiment in which the number of sponsors within VKontakte is not limited for verified communities with 100,000 or more members. The contest must be held directly in the verified community, it is not allowed to create a separate group for the contest.
* **Competitions for activity in the community**For example, to evaluate the participants by leaving "Like" marks or written comments. All activity must be within the community. For example: "Those who have collected the most points will receive prizes. For each "Like" in our group you will receive 1 point, for each comment you write - 2 points".

### Forbidden conditions of contests with prizes

* The promotion will end when **the number of community members, likes, shares, etc. reaches a certain value of any counter**. Also, you cannot announce an increase in the prize pool if the counter reaches a certain value. Example: *"We will raffle off a car when the post reaches one million reposts".*
* The winner will be determined **by the number of "Shares" or "Likes "** under the contest repost on their page. Example: *"The winner will be the person who gets the most likes and reposts under a copy of the contest entry on their own wall. "* Winner will be determined **by the number of "Likes" or "Likes "** under the contest repost on their own wall.
* **Promotions** **addressing user engagement in the community**, including private messaging, sending out invitations to the community or to an event. For example: "Invite N friends to the group", "Write private messages to N people."
* **Change the terms of the contest** during the draw.

**You may not**: reward reposts, be required to leave a set number of likes and comments, or be active outside of the contest community.

Advertising Violations and Restrictions
---------------------------------

### Where you can advertise

Third-party advertising can be placed in clips, stories, on the community wall, and in the link box. The full rules for advertising in communities are set out in the site rules: paragraphs 5\.13\.4 and 5\.13\.5\.

### What are the advertising limits?

There are no limits. However, keep in mind that users join your community primarily for the interesting content. Subscribers are unlikely to stay in a community where only advertising is published. In the short term, this is a good opportunity to make money, but you risk losing your audience quickly.

### What counts as advertising

Any postings, including contest postings, that promote another community, site, product or service.

### Advertising in community posts

A community can use a **chat/bot** to send automated messages to subscribers.

Community posts must be related to the community's theme. The group of a brand, store or organization can send messages about new promotions, products, interesting events. There should be no advertising of any kind in the mailing lists, including promotion of your representation on other platforms.

### Restrictions on the content of advertising publications

According to paragraph 5\.13\.5\ of the rules, all third-party advertisements must comply with paragraphs 1 and 3 of VKontakte's advertising rules.

Below we have compiled an adapted list of objects prohibited from advertising by law, as well as creatives that are questionable in the opinion of the administration, the promotion of which may lead to restrictions for the community. Advertising is prohibited:

1. Using creatives containing:
* **Exaggerated unsupported promises**: *"Find out who your partner is cheating on you with "*, *"Make a million a week with options"*.

* Distorting the essence of news **by** **disclosure,** with speculation on **tragic events** (murder, suicide, death, terrorist attack), as well as with **provocative content** misleading or intended to shock users.
* Obscene and unaesthetic images, shock\content, pornography, child sexuality themes, any sexual fetishes, explicit erotica, including drawn erotica, and any other enticements utilizing **themes of sex and sexuality**.

* * *- contain statements that exaggerate the likelihood of winning a prize
* * *- create the impression that winning is guaranteed or that participation in intellectual/commercial games is a means of livelihood.
* Regardless of our site's position, if the community violates the laws on organizing and conducting gambling on the Internet and the supervisory authorities send us a request for blocking, we will be forced to take action.
