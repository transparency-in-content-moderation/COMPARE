Discord Community Guidelines
============================

#### Effective: April 15, 2024

#### Last Updated: March 15, 2024

We created Discord to be the best place to talk, hang out, and have fun with friends online. Our Community Guidelines ensure everyone can express themselves and find community — but not at the expense of anyone else.

These Guidelines explain what isn’t allowed on Discord. Everyone on Discord must follow these rules, and they apply to all parts of our platform, including your content, behaviors, servers, and Apps. To learn more about the requirements for developing a bot or other App, please refer to our Discord Developer Terms of Service and our Discord Developer Policy.

If you plan to monetize your content, please review the additional rules outlined in our Monetization Policy and Monetization Terms.

Our Trust & Safety team reviews reports by users, moderators, trusted third-party partners, or where required by law. When we reactively or proactively discover a violation of these Guidelines, we may take a number of enforcement steps against them, including issuing warnings, removing content, suspending or removing the violative accounts and/or servers, and potentially reporting them to law enforcement. We may consider relevant off-platform behavior when making assessments for violations of specific Community Guidelines.

If you come across an account, server, or content that appears to break these Guidelines, please report it to us.

Respect Each Other
------------------

**1. Do not promote, coordinate, or engage in harassment.** We do not allow any type of harassing behavior, including sustained bullying, sexual harassment, ban or block evasion, or coordinating server joins for the purpose of harassing server members (“server raiding”). (See our Bullying, Harassment, and Threats Policy Explainer for more.)

**2. Do not threaten to harm another individual or group of people.** This includes direct, indirect, and suggestive threats. (See our Bullying, Harassment, and Threats Policy Explainer for more.)

**3. Do not share or threaten to share the personally identifiable information (PII) of an individual without consent.** This includes providing services that facilitate doxxing, such as buying or selling doxxes or compiling doxxes for others. (See our Doxxing Policy Explainer for more.)

**4. Do not use hate speech or engage in other hateful conduct.** This includes the use of hate symbols, imagery, and claims that deny the history of mass human atrocities.

We consider **hate speech** to be any form of expression that either attacks other people or promotes hatred or violence against them based on their protected characteristics. (See our Hateful Conduct Policy Explainer for more.)

**5. Do not organize, promote, or support violent extremism.** This also includes coordinating violent acts; glorifying or promoting violence or the perpetrators of violent acts; and promoting conspiracy theories that could encourage or incite violence against others. (See our Violent Extremism and Violence and Graphic Content Policy Explainers for more.)

**6. Do not solicit, share, or make any attempt to distribute content that depicts, promotes, or attempts to normalize child sexual abuse.** Also, do not post content or engage in conduct that in any way sexualizes children. This includes real as well as manipulated media, animation (such as lolicon), and any type of digital creation (note that this includes AI-generated media).

We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which may subsequently work with local law enforcement. (See our Teen and Child Safety Policy Explainer for more.)

**7. If you are under the age of 18, do not engage in sexual conduct or any conduct that puts your online or physical safety at risk.** This includes consensual sexual interactions between teens, as well as any encouragement or coordination of potentially risky behaviors, such as vigilantism.

We want teens to be able to express themselves freely on Discord as much as possible, but given the risks associated with online dating, we will remove spaces that encourage or facilitate dating between teens. (See our Teen and Child Safety Policy Explainer for more.)

**8. Do not solicit sexual content from or engage in any sexual conduct with anyone under the age of 18.** We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which may subsequently work with local law enforcement. (See our Teen and Child Safety Policy Explainer for more.)

**9. Do not make sexually explicit content available to anyone under the age of 18.** You must be age 18 or older to engage with adult content on Discord.

Server owners must apply an age-restricted label to any channels that contain sexually explicit content.

Users may not post sexually explicit content in any space that cannot be age-restricted, including in avatars, custom statuses or bios, server banners, server icons, invite splashes, emoji, and stickers. (See our Sexual Content Policy Explainer for more.)

**10. Do not share, distribute, or create sexually explicit or sexually suggestive content of other people without the subject’s consent.** This includes the non-consensual distribution of intimate media that was created either with or without an individual’s consent. (See our Non-Consensual Adult Intimate Media Policy Explainer for more.)

**11. Do not share content that glorifies, promotes, or normalizes suicide or other acts of physical self-harm.** This includes content that encourages others to cut, burn, or starve themselves, as well as content that normalizes eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. Self-harm acts or threats used as a form of emotional manipulation or coercion are also prohibited. (See our Suicide and Self-Harm Policy Explainer for more.)

**12. Do not share real media depicting gore, excessive violence, or animal harm, especially with the intention to harass or shock others.** (See our Violence and Graphic Content Policy Explainer for more.)

Respect Discord
---------------

**13. Do not send unsolicited bulk messages (or spam) to others.** Also, do not facilitate this activity, such as by selling spambots, server “raid” tools, account-creation tools, token generators, CAPTCHA-solving services, or other spam tools. (See our Platform Manipulation Policy Explainer for more.)

**14. Do not use self-bots or user-bots.** Each account must be associated with a human, not a bot. (See our Platform Manipulation Policy Explainer for more.)

**15. Do not engage with our service in an inauthentic way.** This includes artificially inflating server membership, manipulating engagement metrics, and selling artificial engagement services. (See our Platform Manipulation Policy Explainer for more.)

**16. Do not sell or purchase Discord assets**, including accounts, usernames, servers, server permissions, or custom server invite links. (See our Platform Manipulation Policy Explainer for more.)

Abuse of Discord's paid features or monetization opportunities are covered under our Paid Service Terms.

**17. Do not share false or misleading information (otherwise known as misinformation).** Content that is false, misleading, and can lead to significant risk of physical or societal harm may not be shared on Discord. We may remove content if we reasonably believe its spread could result in damage to physical infrastructure, injury of others, obstruction of participation in civic processes, or the endangerment of public health. (See our Misinformation Policy Explainer for more.)

**18. Do not misrepresent your identity on Discord in a deceptive or harmful way.** This includes creating fake profiles and attempts to impersonate an individual, group, or organization. (See our Identity and Authenticity Policy Explainer for more.)

**19. Do not evade permanent Discord-level enforcement actions.** This includes creating new or using existing accounts or communities after being removed for violating our platform rules. (See our Identity and Authenticity Policy Explainer for more.)

**20. Do not engage in activities that could damage or compromise the security of an account, network, or system.** This includes using deceptive techniques to trick others into revealing sensitive information (phishing), using malicious software (malware), and flooding a target with traffic in order to make a resource unavailable (denial-of-service attacks). (See our Deceptive Practices Policy Explainer for more.)

**21. Do not use or attempt to use Discord to promote, coordinate, or execute financial scams.** A financial scam is any intentionally deceptive act taken with the intent to receive an illegal, unethical, or otherwise dishonest gain. (See our Deceptive Practices Policy Explainer for more.)

**22. Do not engage in activities that fraudulently generate a profit at the expense of others.** This includes facilitating, providing instructions for, and participating in fraud. We do not allow coordinated efforts to defraud businesses, price gouging, forgery, money laundering, counterfeit goods, or tools that facilitate illegal behavior. (See our Deceptive Practices Policy Explainer for more.)

**23. Do not submit false, misleading, or abusive reports or requests to Discord’s support teams.** A report or request will be considered false or misleading if it contains demonstrably untrue information submitted with the intent to manipulate staff into taking a desired action. (See our Discord Support Abuse Policy Explainer for more.)

Follow the Law
--------------

**24. Do not share content that violates anyone's intellectual property or other rights.** This includes sharing or selling game cheats or hacks. (See our Unauthorized Copyright Access Policy for more.)

For more information on how Discord handles copyright complaints, please view our Copyright & Intellectual Property Policy.

**25. Do not organize, promote, or engage in the selling or facilitation of sales of regulated or potentially dangerous goods.** Regulated goods have laws in place that restrict the purchase, sale, trade, or ownership of the goods. Dangerous goods have a reasonable potential to cause real-world, physical harm to individuals. (See our Dangerous and Regulated Goods Policy Explainer for more.)

**26. Do not coordinate or participate in illegal gambling.** Users are responsible for complying with applicable gambling laws and regulation. (See our Gambling Policy Explainer for more.)

**27. Do not organize, promote, or engage in any other illegal activity**, such as human trafficking or sexual solicitation. (See our Human Trafficking and Sexual Solicitation Policy Explainers for more.)

If you see any content or activity that violates these Guidelines, our Terms of Service, or our other policies, please report it to us. You can learn more on how to report to us here. However, please note that we strongly discourage and may take action against vigilantism, as this behavior can put individuals in harm’s way and can also interfere with our investigations and ability to report to law enforcement.

These Guidelines will continue to evolve over time. This means we may take action against an account, server, or content that violates the spirit of these Guidelines when we encounter a new threat or harm that is not explicitly covered in the current version.

We will always make our best effort to notify you when we update these Guidelines, but it is up to you to follow the spirit of them: Keep Discord safe and help us continue to make it the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online. Thanks for doing your part.

**Bullying and Harassment**
---------------------------

At Discord, we take a firm stance against harassment and bullying. Bullying and harassment is defined as intentional actions that are meant to cause distress or intimidate individuals. This type of behavior can have serious consequences and cause lasting harm to the victims, as well as those who witness it. We are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive environment on Discord, and we expect all users to treat each other with respect.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Sending unwelcome or unwanted sexual content to an individual
* Disclosing an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity without consent
* Calling for the suicide or self-harm of others
* Coordinating off-platform harassment
* Organizing or participating in server raids
* Statements of disrespect that attempt to humiliate an individual
* Posting content with the intent to cause disgust, anger, or fear, including content that mocks the death of an individual
**Threats**
-----------

We have a strict policy against any form of threats towards others. This includes threats of physical attacks, emotional suffering, reputational damage, and any hostile actions intended to cause pain, loss, or injury. We may escalate threats to law enforcement if we believe it is required to prevent immediate harm.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Threatening to physically harm another individual or group of people
* Threatening to hack another individual's account, network, or system
* Threatening to reveal another individual’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as a name, home address, Social Security number, and any other sensitive data
* Threatening to reveal another individual’s private sexual content

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Don’t engage in behavior that may intimidate or cause suffering to others
* Don’t threaten to physically or mentally harm another individual or group of people

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**How to Report Violations of These Policies**
----------------------------------------------

Reporting safety violations is critically important to keeping you and the broader Discord community safe. All Discord users can report policy violations by following the instructions here. For more information on these policies, please reference our Community Guidelines #1 and #2.

**Doxxing**
-----------

At Discord, we take a firm stance against doxxing. We do not tolerate anyone putting somebody in danger by leaving them vulnerable to data breaches, targeted harassment, and real-world threats such as physical harm. **Doxxing** is when someone shares the Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, of another person without their permission and with the intention to cause harm. A **dox** is the collection of the Personally Identifiable Information of another person.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes any information that could be used to identify an individual, such as a name, home address, social security number, banking information, driver's license number, and any other sensitive data.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Sharing the Personally Identifiable Information of another person in an effort to harass or humiliate them
* Posting links to websites containing doxxes
* Arranging food delivery to an address without the target's consent as a form of harassment
* Selling doxxes or otherwise making them available as a service (“doxxing-as-a-service”)
* Participating in a server dedicated to collecting doxxes
**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Don’t share the Personally Identifiable Information of others
* If you find yourself in a server that is sharing this type of content, report it and consider removing yourself from the space

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**Hate Speech**
---------------

Discord is a place where people come to hang out with friends. As part of our goal to promote acceptance and inclusivity, we prohibit hate speech, discrimination, and prejudice.

We don’t allow hateful conduct or the use of hate speech while on Discord. This includes the use of hate symbols and the denial of historical mass atrocities. We define **hate speech** to include any expression that degrades, vilifies, or dehumanizes individuals, incites intense feelings of hostility towards defined groups, or promotes harm based on protected characteristics.

**Protected characteristics** at Discord encompass various aspects, such as age; caste; color; disability; ethnicity; family responsibilities; gender; gender identity; housing status; national origin; race; refugee or immigration status; religious affiliation; serious illness; sex; sexual orientation; socioeconomic class and status; source of income; status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking; as well as weight and size.

However, we understand that there are nuances and will give exceptions in instances of reclaimed language, satire, educational or documentary purposes. The use of satire must be obvious and we will not allow users to deflect blame retroactively by claiming their statements were made ironically or as a joke.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Expressing contempt, loathing, or disgust towards members of protected groups based on their inherent characteristics
* Purposefully dehumanizing individuals based on their relation with protected groups
* Perpetuating negative stereotypes about protected groups through derogatory generalizations and insulting misrepresentations
* Repeatedly using slurs to degrade and demean individuals or groups. This includes intentionally deadnaming or misgendering a transgender person
* Threatening, glorifying, or promoting physical harm against members of protected groups
* Claiming that a protected group is inherently inferior due to perceived deficiencies
* Calling for exclusion, segregation, or discrimination against protected groups
* Spreading unfounded claims about protected groups to incite fear, hostility, or violence
* Denying well-documented mass human atrocities or casting doubt on their occurrence
**Hate Symbols and Imagery**
----------------------------

The use or sharing of hate symbols or imagery is strictly prohibited on Discord. This policy extends to all images uploaded or shared on Discord, including profiles, channels, and servers.

Hate symbols include acronyms, numbers, phrases, logos, flags, gestures and other miscellaneous symbols used to promote or incite hatred, threats, discrimination, or violence against other people on the basis of protected characteristics. Symbols that represent supremacy of one group over another are also prohibited under this policy.

However, exceptions may be made in instances where hate symbols are shared for educational, historical, newsworthy, or culturally appropriate and non-hateful purposes.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:Sharing any hate symbol or imagery with any of the following intentions:

* To target an individual, group, or server based on their protected characteristic(s) as a way to harass, threaten, or harm them
* To incite fear, hatred, discrimination, or violence against a protected group
* To represent or claim the supremacy of one protected group over another
* Glorify violence against individuals or groups based on their protected characteristics
* Deny the existence of a violent event (such as the Holocaust

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Don’t post or share hateful content as a whole — even as a joke
* Double-check reputable sources to make sure the content is not a conspiracy theory or has roots in hateful ideology

If you find yourself in a server that is sharing this type of content, report it and consider removing yourself from the space

**How to Report Violations of These Policies**
----------------------------------------------

Reporting safety violations is critically important to keeping you and the broader Discord community safe. All Discord users can report policy violations right in the app by following the instructions here. For more information on these policies, please reference our Community Guidelines #4.

**Violent Extremism**
---------------------

At Discord, we take a firm stance against violent extremism. We do not tolerate the presence or activities of violent extremist organizations and other violent groups. Users are not allowed to use Discord to organize, promote, or support violent extremist activities or beliefs. The term **violent extremist organization** describes groups that promote a political, ideological, or religious agenda and tolerate, advocate for, or use violence to achieve their goals.

This policy covers a wide range of actors, such as terrorist groups, violent extremist organizations, and violent hate groups. We also include informal groups or networks, as well as paramilitary and non-state armed groups, that are organized around extremist beliefs under this policy.

Even if not associated with a violent extremist group, users may not share or promote content associated with these groups or content that advocates for violent extremist beliefs on Discord.

As one of the highest-harm areas of abuse, violent extremist organizing is also subject to our Off-Platform Behaviors Policy.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Coordinating users, either on or off Discord, to participate in activities that support or promote a violent extremist organization
	+ This includes attempts to fundraise for or provide donations to violent extremist organizations, groups, or movements
	+ This also includes harassing, doxxing (revealing personal information without consent), or attacking others on behalf of a violent extremist group or in support of violent extremist beliefs
* Recruiting individuals to join a violent extremist group, organization, or movement
* Posting propaganda, promotional materials, or other content associated with violent extremist groups, movements, or figures
* Sharing conspiracy theories or maliciously manipulated media content in an effort to support a violent extremist group or belief
* Praising, justifying, or otherwise supporting the actions or activities of violent extremist organizations, groups, or movements
* Representing or claiming to represent a violent extremist organization or group
* Other similar behaviors
**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

* Don’t pretend or claim to be a member of a terrorist or violent extremist group to others
* If you find yourself in a server that is sharing this type of content, report it and consider removing yourself from the space

**Violent and Graphic Media**
-----------------------------

At Discord, we are committed to creating a safe and positive online environment. We do not allow the uploading or sharing of any material depicting real violence, gore, or animal cruelty. Violent and graphic media can include various forms of content, such as portraying death or injury, showing detailed physical harm happening to individuals, or depicting the infliction of pain, fear, or distress to animals.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Uploading or streaming media depicting real violence, gore, or animal cruelty
* Owning or participating in a server that is dedicated to obtaining or sharing violent and graphic media
**Glorification and Incitement of Violence**
--------------------------------------------

The glorification and incitement of acts of violence pose a serious threat to the well-being and mental health of individuals, as well as the safety of our communities on and off Discord. We have a strict policy against any form of threats or harm towards others. We may escalate threats to law enforcement if we believe it is required to prevent immediate harm.

**“Glorification of violence”** refers to the act of admiring or celebrating acts of physical harm towards humans that cause death, injury, or harm. **“Incitement**” of violence includes organizing, coordinating, promoting, or encouraging acts of violence to be carried out.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Supporting or glorifying dangerous organizations, mass murderers, or serial killers
* Coordinating, promoting, or inciting violence against individuals, groups of people, or events that could result in serious physical harm or death
* Sharing content that portrays the enjoyment or celebration of violence
* Promoting, celebrating, or inciting sexual violence against others
* Coordinating, promoting, or celebrating swatting (false emergency reporting)

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Do not share media depicting graphic content
* Do not glorify dangerous organizations, mass murderers, or serial killers
* Do not engage in the incitement, glorification, or celebration of violence (including sexual violence) against individuals or groups of people
* Do not celebrate, advocate, or promote swatting of others

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**Child Sexualization**
-----------------------

Content that sexualizes children has no place on Discord or in society. We don't tolerate any kind of text or media — real or generated — on our platform that portrays children in a sexual manner. This type of content causes serious harm to victims.

We consider Off-Platform Behaviors when reviewing content under this policy due to the high-harm nature of the offense.

We report illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Users who post this content are permanently banned from Discord.

You may not post or share the following types of content, such as: [sensitive language content warning]* Portrayals of minors engaging in sex acts, or in sexually explicit or suggestive poses
* Sexual comments about or desires for real or fictitious minors
* Links to websites containing material that sexualizes minors
* Photos or videos of non-nude minors in a sexualized or fetishistic context
* Statements expressing intent to obtain materials of child abuse or engage in child sexual abuse
* Promotion, encouragement or normalization of pedophilia or sexual attraction to children
* Photos, videos, or drawings of nude or sexualized minors, such as “lolicon” or “shotacon”
* Photos, videos or illustrations of naked or sexualized anthropomorphized minors (sometimes referred to as “cub porn”)

**Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Teens and Grooming**
--------------------------------------------------------

Discord has a zero-tolerance policy towards individuals who engage in sexual grooming, extortion (sometimes referred to as “sextortion”), or the sexual exploitation of minors. Users who engage in this behavior will be permanently removed from Discord on a first offense. We consider anyone under the age of 18 to be a minor and anyone 18 or over to be an adult.

Given the high-harm nature of this content, we will also consider off-platform evidence as explained in our Off-Platform Behaviors Policy when reviewing content under this policy.

You may not engage in the following types of behavior, such as: [sensitive language content warning]* Send sexually explicit content to a minor
* Ask for sexually explicit content from a minor
* Participate in sexual conversations with a minor, including “erotic roleplay”
* Create or moderate a server that allows sexual interactions with minors, such as a dating server
* Create or moderate a server that gives minors access to sexually explicit content
* Manipulate a minor in order to have a sexual interaction with them (also known as “grooming”)
* Threaten a minor to share sexual content of themselves or engage in sexual behaviors (also known as “sextortion”)
* Attempt to meet with a minor in real life for sexual purposes

**Teen Self-Endangerment**
--------------------------

We take the safety of our younger users seriously and don't allow children under the age of 13 to have a Discord account. We want our teen users to be able to express themselves freely on Discord while also taking steps to ensure these users don’t engage in risky behaviors that might endanger their safety and wellbeing.

We also don’t allow servers that encourage or facilitate dating between teens, even if run by teens themselves. These types of spaces can make our teen communities targets for others who may want to exploit them and can inadvertently facilitate other violations of this policy.

While we understand that teens may want to help each other stay safe online, we cannot allow users or communities to put themselves in potential harm’s way. This means that we will take action against users or servers that we reasonably believe are trying to “bait” or entrap others into inappropriate interactions with teenage users.

We want teens to be safe on Discord, but we also don’t want to penalize them for expressing themselves or exploring their identities. We expect that some users might violate this policy without realizing it, so we provide warnings to teen users where possible. However, for their own safety, we permanently remove a user’s account from the platform if we see consistent violations of this policy or if the user appears to be in immediate risk of harm.

If you are under the age of 18, you may not engage in the following types of behavior, such as: [sensitive language content warning]* Send sexually explicit text, images, videos, or audio to another user or in a server
* Send your own sexually explicit content (“nudes”) to another user — even if they’re also under 18
* Ask for others to send you sexually explicit content
* Set up or run a server for other users to date or find romantic partners — even if users aren’t planning to meet in real life
* Participate in a dating server
* Share or attempt to sell sexually suggestive content of yourself to other users (such as: thigh pics, feet pics, etc.)
* Deliberately try to “bait,” trick, or entrap an adult user into sending sexual content to yourself or another underage user

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* Do not post about sexualizing, grooming, or abusing children — even as a joke
* Do not send or ask for sexual content from anyone under the age of 18 — even if you are also under 18
* If you are an adult and run a server that allows sexual content, make sure that you mark any channel that contains sexually explicit content with an “age gate”
* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**How to Report Violations of These Policies**
----------------------------------------------

Reporting safety violations is critically important to keeping you and the broader Discord community safe. All Discord users can report policy violations right in the app by following the instructions here. For more information on these policies, please reference our Community Guidelines #6, #7, and #8.

**Sexual Content**
------------------

At Discord, we believe users should feel comfortable expressing themselves. That’s why we allow our adult users (18+) to post and share sexual content, so long as it aligns with our policies. We also understand that not everyone wants to see this type of content, and that this content isn’t appropriate for our younger users. In order to maintain a safe environment for all, we have limitations on where sexually explicit content can be posted on Discord and how it can be accessed.

### **[Sensitive language content warning]**

Discord defines **sexually explicit content** as any content that presents genitalia, female nipples, the anus, or sexual activity without censoring or obscuring it. **Sexually suggestive content** is any content that may evoke sexual arousal without being overt in description or depiction of genitalia, female nipples, the anus, or sexual activity.

The following types of content will be considered “sexually explicit content” and may only be shared in “age-restricted” spaces:* Texts that openly or clearly describes partial or full adult nudity, such as sexually graphic text as part of a fanfiction story or sexually stimulating roleplay exchange
* Media that openly or clearly depicts partial or full adult nudity, such as a photo of a nude individual or a videos of individuals engaged in a sex act
* Drawn or AI-generated text or imagery that includes graphic sexual content
* Sexually suggestive content that is clearly and only being shared for the explicit purpose of sexual satisfaction
While we may make exceptions for educational or newsworthy content, in general, all sexually explicit content on Discord is considered *age-restricted* and should only be posted or accessed by users who are 18 years of age or older.

**Sexually explicit content should not be posted in general open access areas within Discord:**

* ***For servers***, this includes any sections of a server’s profile where content can be posted and seen outside of the server, such as the server name, server invite link, server invite background, and server icon. This also includes content hosted *within* a server that can be posted elsewhere on the platform, such as stickers and emojis.
* ***For user and bot accounts***, these surfaces include all sections of the User Profile, such as the username, display name, avatar, banner, and About Me sections. Users may not post sexual content in any sections of their account’s server profiles *unless the server profile is associated with a server that is entirely age-gated.*

Servers *can* host sexually explicit content within their server as long as it does not violate our policies, the server owner and moderators are all over the age of 18 and any channel where sexually explicit content is hosted is marked with an age-restricted label. You can learn how to apply an age-restricted label to your server channels here. Please note that we may also place an age-gate on an entire server if it appears that that server is primarily being used to host sexual content.

Finally, although we want to provide adult users with the freedom to express their sexuality and engage with sexual content at their own choice and risk, sexual content that is likely to lead to serious bodily harm or death is disallowed even if consensually shared and consumed.

In addition, Discord has a zero-tolerance policy towards those who engage in sexual grooming, extortion (sometimes referred to as “sextortion”), or the sexual exploitation of children or teens under the age of 18. Learn more about our Teen and Child Safety Policies.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Posting content that encourages sexual behavior that could lead to serious injury or death
* Creating or moderating a server that encourages or normalizes sexual activities that could lead to serious bodily injury or death

**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

* Don’t put sexually explicit content in the sections of your user profile
* Don’t post or share sexual content that could encourage other people to physically harm themselves or someone else
* Don’t send sexual content directly to others unless you’re sure they want to see or receive it
* If you’re posting sexual content in a server, make sure you’re posting it in an age-gated channel
* If you own a server and want to allow sexual content:
	+ Make sure your moderators are the age of 18+
	+ Put age-restricted labels on channels where members can post this content
	+ Don’t post sexual content on server surfaces that could be seen by non-server members, such as in the server name, icon, invite link, invite background, stickers, or emojis

**Non-Consensual Adult Intimate Media**
---------------------------------------

At Discord, we take a firm stance against the sharing, distribution, taking, or creation of sexually explicit or sexually suggestive content of other people without their knowledge or consent.

The term **non-consensual sharing or distribution of adult intimate media** means sharing intimate or sexually explicit content without the person's knowledge or consent, whether it's with a group or one person.

This includes media taken or created without an individual’s knowledge or consent (for example, hidden cameras, "creepshots", videos of sexual assault, AI-generated sexual images such as "deepfakes"), as well as media that was originally obtained or created with consent (for example, within the context of a private or intimate relationship, sometimes known as “revenge porn” or “image-based sexual abuse”). In order to protect victims and stop the proliferation of non-consensual adult intimate media (NCAIM), we will remove confirmed instances of this content.

We take the threat to share or distribute NCAIM seriously and will take appropriate action covered under our Threats Policy. This includes the threat to share non-consensual intimate media unless a demand is met, otherwise known as **sextortion**. This policy covers the content of adults only, for content involving minors, please see our Teen and Child Safety Policies.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in: [sensitive language content warning]* Sharing, distributing, taking, or creating:
	+ Sexually explicit or suggestive media (also known as “revenge porn”, “non-consensual pornography”, or “image-based sexual abuse”) without explicit consent from the individual(s) involved
	+ Secretly taken media of an individual’s commonly sexualized body parts (breasts, groin, buttocks, thighs, genitals, cleavage, etc.) without the individual’s knowledge
	+ Non-consensual sexualization of individual(s) (sometimes referred to as “tributes”) without explicit consent or knowledge from the individual(s)
	+ Non-consensual sexual content of sexual assault, sexual violence, or sexual abuse
* Creating, commissioning, sharing, or distributing altered or generated intimate media of individual(s) without explicit consent or knowledge from the individual(s) involved
	+ This includes AI-generated media, as well as altered audiovisual media, often referred to as "deepfakes” or “deepnudes”
* Sharing, distributing, taking, or reproducing “paywalled” sexually explicit or sexually suggestive content without explicit consent from the individual(s) involved

	+ **Paywalled content** refers to content that is exclusive to the people paying for it

**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

* Do not post or share non-consensual sexual content as a whole — even as a joke
* We understand consent can change at any time. If you do not have explicit and informed consent of the subject — do not post it. This includes sexual AI-generated media
* If you find yourself in a server that is sharing this type of content, report it and consider removing yourself from the space

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**Suicide and Self-Harm Risk**
------------------------------

At Discord, we are committed to creating a safe online environment and preventing harm. We understand the importance of a strong community and positive surroundings when it comes to mental well-being.

We do not allow coordinating acts of self-harm or showing harmful actions towards oneself. Self-harm is when someone deliberately hurts themselves physically. Examples of self-harm behaviors include intentionally ending one's life, engaging in disordered eating patterns, etc.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in: [sensitive language content warning]* Coordinating an act of self-harm
* Showing or depicting graphic self-harm imagery

**Self-Harm Encouragement and Promotion**
-----------------------------------------

Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstance. We believe in fostering a positive and healthy environment where users can come together to support one another. However, it is important that these discussions do not promote or normalize self-harm behaviors. Our goal is to ensure that everyone feels safe and supported.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in: [sensitive language content warning]* Offering or sharing methods or advice on how to commit an act of self-harm
* Normalizing or encouraging self-harming behaviors
* Discouraging individuals from seeking treatment for self-harming behaviors
* Sharing self-harm material in order to trigger a self-harm response in someone else

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Do not share illustrations of self-harm
* Do not encourage, promote, or normalize self-harm
* Do not discourage others from seeking treatment for self-harming behaviors

**How to Report Violations of These Policies**
----------------------------------------------

Reporting safety violations is critically important to keeping you and the broader Discord community safe. All Discord users can report policy violations in the app by following the instructions here. For more information on these policies, please reference our Community Guidelines #11.

**Resources**
-------------

**If you or another user is in immediate danger, please contact law enforcement right away and let them know what's going on, regardless of the information you're able to provide.**

* Discord partners with Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit that provides 24/7 text-based mental health support and crisis intervention via trained volunteer crisis counselors. Crisis Text Line is currently available to those in the United States and is offered in both English and Spanish. You can read more about this partnership here.

**Platform Abuse**
------------------

Discord is a place where friends come to hang out. As part of our goal to provide users with a good on-platform experience, we prohibit platform abuse.

The term **platform abuse** refers to activities that disrupt or alter the experience of Discord users. Sending unsolicited bulk messages or interactions (or *spam*) is one of the most common ways the user experience is disrupted. Spam can be sent by automated accounts designed for this purpose (*spambots*), normal user accounts that manually execute spammy actions, as well as by user accounts modified to perform automated actions (*self-bots*). Making modifications to the Discord client for the purpose of spam or any other reason is not allowed under this policy.

We will also take action on accounts registered for the purpose of carrying out platform abuse. This includes the automated registration of accounts as a group for spamming — regardless of their message-send rate. We will also remove servers facilitating platform abuse. This includes but is not limited to spaces distributing: spambots, server “raid” tools, account-creation tools, token generators, CAPTCHA-solving services, and other spam tools.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Manually sending unsolicited bulk messages or interactions to others from an unmodified user account
* Using an automated (or bot) account to send unsolicited bulk messages or interactions to other users
* Participating in the coordinated mass-joining of a server with unmodified user accounts
* Coordinating or helping execute the mass-joining of a server with automated accounts
* Modifying a user account to perform automated actions — regardless of the type of action
* Using any type of client modification that alters the appearance or layout of Discord
* Creating or operating inauthentic accounts for the purpose of violating this policy
* Operating a user or bot account with the intention of evading our anti-spam system
* Participating in the sale, trade, or distribution of tools that aid forms of platform abuse

**Inauthentic Engagement**
--------------------------

Inauthentic engagement is closely tied to, but distinct from the issue of spam. Both result in an overall lower-quality experience for users.

**Engagement** in the context of this policy is defined as any user interaction with Discord’s service or product features. We will consider engagement to be **inauthentic** if it is purchased, induced (like promises of financial reward), or fraudulent (for example, it involves fake accounts).

Individuals are prohibited from attempting to manipulate engagement metrics, artificially inflating server membership (for example, via “join-for-join,” “invite rewards,” purchasing fake members), and selling artificial engagement services for online platforms. Individuals also may not attempt to buy or sell Discord assets, such as accounts, usernames, servers, server permissions, or custom server invite links (also called “vanity URLs”).

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Purchasing or inducing engagement; or, using fake accounts to boost such metrics
* Purchasing or inducing server joins; or, using fake accounts to boost member count
* Attempting to sell or purchase a Discord account, username, server, server permissions, or a custom server invite link (also called a “vanity URL”)
* Selling or coordinating the sale of artificial engagement services for online platforms

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* Don’t send multiple unsolicited messages to other users
* Don’t modify the Discord client for any reason — including automating account actions or altering the appearance or layout of Discord
* Grow your server organically and don’t artificially inflate its member count
* Do not sell or purchase a Discord account, username, server, server permissions, or a custom server invite link (or “vanity URL”)

**How to Report Violations of These Policies**

**Health Misinformation**
-------------------------

At Discord, we are committed to creating a safe online environment and preventing harm. We do not allow the promotion or organization of communities that share false or misleading health information that is likely to result in harm. This includes anti-vaccination claims, dangerous and unsupported treatments for health issues, distortion of disease information, and any content that may negatively impact resolving public health emergencies. We rely on credible sources for accurate health information — including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While users can share their own personal health experiences on Discord, we prohibit false or misleading health information that is likely to result in harm.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:Making false or misleading statements about:

* The safety, side effects, or effectiveness of vaccines
* Vaccine ingredients, development, or approval
* Medically unsupported and dangerous treatments for health-related issues
* The existence or prevalence of a disease
* The transmission or symptoms of a disease
* Health guidance, advisories, or mandates
* The availability or eligibility for health services
* Implying a health conspiracy by malicious forces

**Civic Disruption**
--------------------

We are committed to upholding the integrity of civic processes and doing our part to ensure a fair and democratic environment around the world. We don’t allow the posting, promotion, or organization of communities that share false or misleading claims that could disrupt or undermine the civic processes. In addition, we do not tolerate the promotion or organization of attempts to intimidate voters or activities that suppress civic participation.

A **civic process** is any procedure run by governments or international political institutions that relies on public participation to make a decision or reach outcomes that impact our society. Examples of civic processes include elections, referendums, and censuses.

We will remove harmful misinformation about civic processes when we become aware of it. We will determine the truthfulness of claims by looking at independent, third-party sites like PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and Snopes.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:Providing false or misleading information or making false or misleading claims about:

* The event details of a civic process, including time, date, and location of a civic process
* Requirements for participation in a civic process, including who can participate; the information that must be provided; and the materials required for participation
* How to participate in a civic process, including claims that prompt individuals to incorrectly fill out or submit a ballot
* Candidate eligibility or requirements for election, including false claims about age and citizenship requirements; claims about whether a candidate is running for office; and, misinformation about their eligibility
* The results or outcome of a civic process, both before and after results have been certified
* The integrity of a civic process — specifically, around issues that could delegitimize results or undermine faith in public institutions
	+ This includes false accusations of ballot tampering, voter fraud (e.g., non-citizen voting), voter machine errors, and other forms of illegal election rigging
* Making false or misleading claims that could suppress participation in a civic process, including claims about disruptions at polling places; and, statements about the length of lines, police presence, and public health or safety issues
* Supporting, calling for, or coordinating:
	+ forms of fraudulent participation in a civic process
	+ efforts to intimidate participants in a civic process
* Organizing unlawful efforts to disrupt the implementation of the results of a civic process

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Don’t post false testimonials or statements that harmful substances can cure diseases
* Double-check official election resources if you are unsure about specifics before posting
* If you find yourself in a server that is sharing this type of content, report it and consider removing yourself from the space

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**Identity Misrepresentation**
------------------------------

Discord is a place where people come to hang out with friends and build communities. An important condition for building healthy communities is trust in the authenticity of interactions. Discord prohibits users from misrepresenting their identity on our platform in a deceptive or harmful way. This includes creating fake profiles as well as attempts to impersonate an individual, group, or organization.

Although pseudonymous accounts are allowed on Discord, our rules prohibit fake profiles and impersonation. We define a **fake profile** as an online identity for an individual or entity that does not exist. Some fake user profiles can be identified by their use of stolen or generated images as avatars. **Impersonation** means pretending to be a real individual, group, or organization. This typically involves the use of identity details (such as name or likeness) to deceive others about the ownership or affiliation of a digital profile. Impersonation on Discord can occur at the account or server level.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Creating or using a Discord identity for an individual or entity that does not exist
	+ This only applies to fake profiles that deceive others about their ownership or affiliation. Accounts using aliases, stage names, and those without an established identity will not be considered violative of this policy
	+ We will only remove fake profiles if they are used in connection with one of our other Platform Integrity policies: Deceptive Practices, Misinformation, or Platform Manipulation
* Creating or using an account that impersonates an individual, group, bots, or organization
* Owning or operating a server that impersonates an individual, group, or organization

**Platform Ban Evasion**
------------------------

We may take enforcement actions when we discover a violation of our Community Guidelines — up to and including permanent removal from Discord. We typically reserve permanent actions like user and server bans for severe violations that could negatively impact user safety, the integrity of our service, or the rights of others. Permanently removing a violative account or community can lessen the harms from these groups and help prevent abuse from occurring in the future.

You may not circumvent platform-level bans that we take against your account or server. We use the term **ban** to refer to the permanent removal of an account or community for a violation of our rules.

**Platform ban evasion** refers to efforts to return to Discord after having an account or community permanently removed from our service. Platform ban evasion includes the creation of new accounts and communities to bypass permanent removal; it also includes the use or reuse of an existing account or community to avoid a platform-level ban.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Creating a new account after being permanently banned from Discord
* Recreating a server that has been removed from Discord by Trust & Safety
* Repurposing an existing account or server to evade being banned

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

* Don’t misrepresent your identity on Discord in a deceptive or harmful way
* If you run a parody or satire account or server, make sure that it is clearly labeled as such
* Respect platform-level enforcement actions. Individuals who believe their account or server has been incorrectly removed can submit an appeal here

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**How to Report Violations of These Policies**

**Financial Scams**
-------------------

Online scams can cause financial harm to people in the real world. We work hard to keep Discord a safe place for users to connect with their communities — that way, they won’t have to worry about people trying to trick them for illegal or dishonest reasons. Individuals may not use our service to promote, coordinate, or perform any type of financial scam.

Financial scams generally attempt to take advantage of individuals by making false promises of goods, services, or other financial benefits. These schemes try to turn a profit by defrauding victims or tricking them into revealing sensitive information. A non-exhaustive list of financial scams includes: Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, advance-fee fraud, market manipulation (including “pump-and-dump” schemes), romance scams, employment scams, and phishing scams.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Impersonating a legitimate business entity or deliberately misrepresenting the identity of an account or group with the intent to defraud others
* Knowingly requesting investment in a fraudulent or deceptive financial scheme, such as:
	+ Investments in non-existent business ventures (Ponzi schemes)
	+ Ventures that only sustain themselves by recruiting new participants (pyramid schemes)
	+ Any scheme that promises abnormally high returns on an investment (example: money-flipping scams)
	+ All forms of advance-fee fraud (example: giveaway scams)
* Coordinating market manipulation involving stocks, securities, or cryptocurrencies, including “pump and dump” schemes
* Deliberately defrauding others by failing to pay for goods
* Deliberately defrauding others by failing to deliver paid-for goods
* Coordinating, facilitating, or providing instructions on how to execute scams
* Other similar types of behavior

**Malicious Conduct**
---------------------

We want users to enjoy a safe, secure experience on our service. Accordingly, we do not allow activity that could damage or compromise the security of an account, computer network, or system. We use the term “malicious conduct” to refer to phishing, the use of malware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, among other conduct.

**Phishing** is a deceptive technique used to trick others into revealing sensitive information (such as logins or payment details). Individuals may phish for information with manipulated links or fake websites that appear genuine to convince targets they are trustworthy. **Malware** is any type of software used for malicious purposes — including theft of account credentials and other sensitive information. **Denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks flood a target with traffic to make the resource temporarily or permanently unavailable.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Using phishing techniques, such as using fake websites, manipulated links, or URL redirection to collect sensitive information
* Sending malicious code to others as part of an injection attack
* Creating or distributing malware to steal information; grant unauthorized access to an account, network, or system; or block access to a computer
* Using Discord’s content-delivery network (CDN) to host malicious files, malware, or phishing resources for later distribution
* Owning or operating on-platform infrastructure to aid malware operations
* Participating in activity that directly aids or helps facilitate any of the behaviors listed above

**Fraud Services**
------------------

We will permanently remove fraudulent services and all efforts to facilitate illegal behavior when we become aware of it. We use the term **fraud services** to refer to coordinated activity that directly attempts or is part of a larger attempt to fraudulently generate profit at the expense of others. Profit can mean monetary or property gain secured from a third party.

One activity disallowed under this policy is offering access to illicitly-obtained goods — including, but not limited to: account credentials, credit card information, personally identifiable information, and cracked commodity goods. Coordinated efforts to defraud businesses, price gouging, forgery, and money laundering are also not allowed.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Trading, selling, or attempting to purchase illicitly-obtained:
	+ Account login information, such as usernames and passwords
	+ Financial information, such as credit card information and bank account information
	+ Personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers
* Providing access to tools that facilitate account cracking or payment fraud
* Participating in coordinated activities to defraud an individual, business, or organization
	+ This includes making purchases with stolen payment details, exploiting delivery logistics, socially-engineering company support staff, and engaging in chargeback fraud
* Providing instructions or lists of techniques on how to commit fraud
* Participating in an organized scheme to resell goods at a large profit, such as price gouging
* Selling, trading, or purchasing forgeries or participating in forgery operations
* Participating in money laundering schemes

**How to Avoid Violating These Policies**
-----------------------------------------

We take violations of these policies seriously and will take statements of desire or intent to engage in illegal activities at face value.

* Don’t send malicious links. This includes “IP grabbers” and other tools that try to collect other people’s sensitive information
* Don’t engage in fraudulent activities. This means somehow trying to generate a profit at the expense of others
* Don’t participate in communities selling commodity goods that may have been stolen or illicitly obtained

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**Unauthorized Copyright Access**
---------------------------------

At Discord, we take a firm stance against violating intellectual property rights. We respond to facially-valid reports of copyright infringement in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable intellectual property laws. Our Copyright & IP Policy explains this process in detail.

This policy prohibits activity that provides others with direct, unauthorized access to copyrighted material (such as via live-streams) as well as efforts to coordinate such access. Coordination includes services or offers for services that facilitate the unauthorized sale, purchase, or trade of copyrighted material.

This policy also covers types of activity that infringe on the rights of copyright owners, including the distribution of tools that get around copyright protections. Exploits for online games (also called “cheats” or “hacks”) fall under this policy if they circumvent anti-cheating software or impermissibly modify a game’s code or files.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Operating a space dedicated to providing unauthorized access to copyrighted material
	+ This includes channels and servers dedicated to the paid or unpaid sharing, streaming, or other distribution of copyrighted material
* Operating a space dedicated to coordinating unauthorized access to copyrighted material
	+ This includes servers and channels dedicated to facilitating or offering to facilitate the unauthorized sale, purchase, or trade of copyrighted works on or off Discord
* Coordinating unauthorized copyright access via direct message or group direct message
* Operating a space dedicated to distributing tools that get around copyright protections

**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

Respect the intellectual property rights of others - don’t stream or provide access to copyrighted works if you are not authorized to do so

**How to Report Violations of This Policy**
-------------------------------------------

Reporting safety violations is critically important to keeping you and the broader Discord community safe. All Discord users or affected individuals can report policy violations by emailing a report to copyright@discordapp.com.

Tags: Regulated or Illegal Activities

**Dangerous and Regulated Goods**
---------------------------------

Discord prioritizes safety and preventing harm on our platform. Therefore, we do not allow anyone to buy, sell, or trade any potentially dangerous or regulated goods. Dangerous or regulated goods include but are not limited to: firearms; explosives; tactical gear; imitation firearms; illicit drugs; marijuana; alcohol; and tobacco.

We consider a good to be “dangerous” if it has reasonable potential to cause or assist in causing real-world, physical harm to individuals, and “regulated” if there are laws in place that restrict the purchase, sale, trade, or ownership of the good.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Coordinating the illegal selling, buying, or trading of dangerous or regulated goods
* Providing instructions on assembling or building illegal firearms or explosives
	+ Note: This does not include discussion about maintenance of a legal firearm, for example on how to properly and safely disassemble and clean a firearm.
* Providing instructions on manufacturing illegal drugs or regulated substances, such as pharmaceuticals

**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

* If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
* Don’t use Discord to sell, buy, or trade dangerous and regulated goods
* Don’t share instructions on how to put together dangerous and regulated goods
* Don’t share or discuss information about creating illegal drugs or regulated substances
* If you find yourself in a server that is sharing this type of content, report it and consider removing yourself from the space

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

**Gambling**
------------

Users may not use Discord to coordinate or participate in illegal gambling. Users are responsible for complying with relevant gambling laws and regulation.

We define illegal gambling as any gambling activities that break applicable laws and regulations. We define **gambling** as the act of placing a bet or wager involving money or something of value on an event or activity with an uncertain outcome. Our gambling policy is violated if the following criteria are met:

1. There is a payment or wager of real-world value to participate (this includes betting or entry fees)

* *Real-world value* is defined as any tangible or intangible asset with a monetary or exchangeable value in the real world. This includes virtual currency or virtual goods that have a real-world market value or can be exchanged for real-world currency or goods

2. Prizes of real-world value are awarded

3. The outcome of the game is *predominantly* determined by chance

4. The activity is prohibited by applicable gaming laws or regulations

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Organizing, coordinating, facilitating, or engaging in illegal or illicit gambling activities or services
* Coordinating a community dedicated to facilitating illegal gambling operations
	+ This includes coordinating logistics, payments, or community management of users to facilitate or encourage illegal gambling activities
* Sharing third-party links to illegal or illicit gambling sites

**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

* Check gambling laws and regulations applicable to you and make sure you follow them
* Be extra wary of participating in potentially fraudulent activities or opportunities that use or mimic gambling mechanisms, especially those involving paying or receiving financial transactions from others
* Leave and report servers with illegal or illicit gambling content or activity

Tags: Regulated or Illegal Activities

**Human Trafficking**
---------------------

Human trafficking is an abhorrent crime that Discord takes very seriously. We will remove accounts and servers engaged in this activity and may report suspected illegal activity to law enforcement.

These activities include, but are not limited to, the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and sale of victims, as well as any forced, deceptive, or fraudulent attempts used to invite or transfer victims for the purpose of exploitation. Any suspicions of such activities will be reported to law enforcement, and the accounts and servers involved may be removed from our service.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Forcing, deceiving, or fraudulently recruiting people into human trafficking
* Recruiting people to join or support human trafficking organizations
* Advertising or advertising services related to human trafficking
* Organizing transportation, transfer, or harboring of victims of human trafficking
* Supporting a human trafficking organization or enterprise
* Selling or attempting to sell human trafficking services or victims

**How to Avoid Violating This Policy**
--------------------------------------

We will take statements of desire or intent to engage in illegal activities at face-value.

* Do not engage in acts supporting or coordinating human trafficking
* If you aren’t sure if a piece of content might violate this policy, do not post it

If you see this content being shared in a direct message or in a server, report it to us immediately, block the user, and leave the DM or server

**Sexual Solicitation**
-----------------------

At Discord, we prohibit sexual solicitation on our service. Sexual solicitation involves requests from people looking for or offering sexual services in exchange for compensation. This includes activities that would facilitate or encourage in-person sexual meetups, such as advertising or promoting sexual services, as well as coordinating logistics or payments for in-person sexual services.

This policy covers adult-to-adult conduct. Any instances of adult-to-child sexual solicitation will be reviewed under our Teen and Child Safety Policies.

For example, you may not post, share, or engage in:* Advertisements or promotions for in-person sexual services in exchange for compensation
* Requests or offers for sexual services in exchange for compensation
	+ For example: escort services, fetish or domination services, exotic dancing, erotic/tantric massage service, etc.
* Coordinating logistics of meetups for sexual services like payment, transportation, negotiations or location
* Servers dedicated to connecting sex workers to clients
* Recruiting individuals for any type of in-person sex work
