4\. Limitations and requirements on the tracker

All participants of distributions on the tracker are prohibited from:  
4.1. Creating and posting a distribution that duplicates what already
exists on NNM-Club (a duplicate is material that does not differ in
either content or quality; each category may have its own criteria for
duplication; distributions in the Archive are not taken into account).  
4.1. 1. Creating and posting a distribution containing diacritics,
hieroglyphs, Arabic ligature, etc. symbols (Unicode symbols) in the
topic name as the main original name, unless the original is duplicated
by a localized English world wide version of the name or
transliteration, or unless it is duplicated by a version with
similar-looking symbols replaced with Latin ones. This is necessary for
the internal search to work.  
4.2. Creating and posting a distribution containing filming of scenes
and objects that violate generally accepted moral standards,
pornography; drug propaganda; nationalist and racist materials; and
others mentioned in paragraph 2.11 of these Rules; as well as various
Databases that are not freely, legally available to the public, etc.  
4.2.1. Creating and posting a distribution that contains obscene
language, euphemisms, or profanity in the title, description, or file
names.  
4.3. Distributing torrent files and Magnet links received here under
your name (while logged in, linked to your profile) on other Internet
resources.  
4.4. Leaving the distribution after downloading/distribution is complete
until the next 3 downloaders (seeds) appear. The exception is
multi-tracker distributions that are known to have seeds at that moment
that are not displayed in the peer table in the distribution.  
4.5. Closing the distribution channel. The ratio of the volume of
information given to the volume of information downloaded should be
maintained at more than 0.3.

The number of simultaneously allowed downloads is proportional to the
Ratio (you can see it in your profile).  
If the uploaded volume is less than 20 GB, 2 simultaneous downloads are
allowed (3 downloads if the Ratio is greater than 1).  
If more than 20 gigabytes are uploaded, the following are allowed:  
- 2 downloads if the Ratio is \> 0.3,  
- 3 downloads if the Ratio is \> 0.6,  
- 4 downloads if the Ratio is \> 0.9,  
- 5 downloads if the Ratio is \> 1.2, etc. one download for every 0.3
Ratio.  
If the Ratio is \< 0.3 and the downloaded volume is 20 Gb, downloads are
prohibited. One-time reset of the ratio is allowed.  
Uploading fully downloaded releases is ALWAYS allowed, in order to
provide the opportunity to increase the rating unlimitedly.

4.6. Creating and posting for downloading a distribution located in
cumulative files without prior approval from the relevant Moderator,
namely:  
- in an archive (RAR, ZIP, …) - is prohibited in all tracker
categories,  
- in a disk image (ISO, MDF, NRG, …) - is prohibited in all categories
except for “Games”, “Programs”, “Multimedia Editions”, “Automotive
Programs”, “HD Audio and Multichannel Music” and “3D Blu-Ray”
distributions in the corresponding subforums.  
4.7. Unauthorized deletion of a torrent file and/or design from a
previously approved distribution.  
Remember: by posting a release, it becomes public domain.  
4.8. Using fake and cheating torrent clients/utilities on the tracker
and other methods of manipulating Upload/Download and deceiving the
tracker's statistics accounting system (your account will be deactivated
or deleted without warning with the entire Upload reset).

All participants creating a distribution on the tracker (posting a file
for public downloading) are required to:  
4.9. Before creating a release, personally check the quality of this
distribution and the accuracy of the information provided about it, such
as:  
no sound in films, advertising and other damage, desynchronization of
sound and video; incorrectly specified translation in films - dubbed
instead of voice-over, or voice-over language, etc.; unremoved
protection in DVD Video and programs; inoperability of the program and /
or software activation tools; discrepancy with the specified version of
the program; infection of distributed files with malware; undeclared
capabilities of programs and / or additional software, especially not
included in the official distribution as a result of its repackaging,
including causing unexpected damage to users, as well as an uncontrolled
restart of the operating system; etc.).

5\. Rules for commenting on torrents

5.1. The comment system was created in order to:  
- ask a question regarding the specifics of the distribution, if it is
not sufficiently covered in the description or a similar question was
not considered in the comments above,  
- provide interesting or important information related to the
distribution.  
Note: you can and should express respect to the author of the
distribution and gratitude for the release by clicking the “thank you”
button, you can and should show solidarity with the author of the
comment or express gratitude for a useful comment by clicking the “like”
button, and in comments to multi-page topics, and especially to
distributions of the Programs and Games categories - exclusively with
their help due to the typically rapid filling of pages with
insignificant comments and the difficulty of finding truly important
details of the discussion there.  
5.2. We welcome friendly comments containing additional interesting or
useful information, including simply appropriate witty and funny
messages (with the exception of discussions of distributions with
multi-page topics).  
5.3. If you do not intend to join the distribution, do not comment on
it.  
5.4. No language other than literary Russian is allowed in the
comments.  
5.5. Flame, flooding, and incitement to them, as well as trolling and
other provocations are prohibited.  
5.6. Overquoting is prohibited. Quote only important, essential parts of
the message you are responding to.  
If there is a need to quote a long message, put it in a spoiler.  
5.7. Unreasoned negative comments regarding the release or the releaser
are prohibited.  
Remember: distributions on the tracker are not intended to satisfy your
personal requests; if you don’t like a distribution, silently pass by,
look for something more suitable for you personally, without negative
comments here.  
5.8. Unreasoned statements about the content of malware (viruses, etc.)
in distributions without a screenshot of the antivirus window with
information about the threat (or a similar excerpt from the antivirus
log file), without the name/version of the antivirus software used and
the date of antivirus signatures (virus database updates) are
prohibited.  
It is strongly recommended to check the disputed file on virustotal.com
and provide a link to the results of scanning this file in the comment.

6.8. Moderators can close releases from comments and/or move them to the
archive or tempo if the release is no longer relevant; if the release is
considered a repeat; if there are no seeders on the distribution for

essence of the release in the comments; or for other reasons.  
6.9. Moderators can issue users a warning for non-compliance with the
