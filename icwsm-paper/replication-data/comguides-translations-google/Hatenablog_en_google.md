  homepage

If there is a post that is likely to cause harm to persons or property,
such as a suicide threat, crime threat, or intimidation, or if there is
disruptive behavior that impedes the operation of our services and we
judge the situation to be urgent, Hatena may consult with and report the
matter to the police. In addition, we may withhold deletion or other
measures while we investigate the matter.

The above measures will also apply if you are subscribed to a paid plan
or support program, and we will not provide any compensation or
reparations for any damages caused by them.

### Cautions and advice and inquiries

Depending on the circumstances of your usage, we may issue a warning if
your usage is causing inconvenience to other users or if it may violate
any of the precautions or prohibitions set out by Hatena.

Additionally, we may receive requests from third parties to delete
information pursuant to the Provider Liability Limitation Act, and ask
for opinions to determine whether or not to delete the information.

These notifications will be sent to the email address registered with
Hatena. If you do not follow the warnings and do not improve your usage,
or if you do not reply within the grace period indicated in the email,
you may be subject to measures such as suspension of use or publication.
Please ensure that your registered email address is able to receive
emails and regularly check the contents of your inbox.

### About Youth Protection

If there is any use that may violate laws and regulations, such as
exchanging contact information with minors or making arrangements to
meet in person, we may take emergency measures, such as immediately
making the blog private or suspending the account itself.

In addition, if we receive an official inquiry from school officials or
the police regarding bullying, sexual assault, etc., we may disclose
information such as usage status within the scope of our privacy policy
in order to resolve the issue.

If the content is not clearly for adults, but is not suitable for
viewing by minors, we may take zoning measures to withhold display on
some pages. We may also ask for correction by issuing a warning.

### Restrictions on trend word blogs and summary blogs

Regarding trending word blogs (blogs that mainly publish crime reports,
entertainment information, and topics covered by the mass media) and
summary blogs (blogs that compile comments from anonymous message boards
and news sites), if they fall under the items below and are found to be
ethically problematic, we may restrict the display range or exclude them
from the index of search sites.

- Articles that do not contain any opinions or commentary expressed by
  the author, but are merely reprints of articles from other media
- Anything that contains obscene content or strongly suggests such
  content through its title, etc.
- Contains cruel or shocking content, or has a title or other content
  that strongly suggests such content
- Anything that may violate privacy, such as disclosing private names,
  photos, or facts about private life
- Anything that may infringe on third party copyrights, such as posting
  captured images from television programs or reprinting publications.
- Those that are linked to many blogs like the above through mutual
  links, antennas, mutual RSS, etc.

However, if it is clear that the use constitutes an offense as set forth
in these Guidelines, it will be subject to the measures set forth in
"Measures Against Inappropriate Use" as a violation of the Guidelines.

### Responding to potentially dangerous information

In particular, in areas such as health, medicine, food safety, and
public health, if a site contains opinions that contradict standard
medical information or unique opinions that could pose a risk to human
life, Hatena may insert a warning to readers and a link to a neutral
source of information or an appropriate consultation desk. Hiding the
inserted information using CSS or other methods is prohibited.

What does Hatena think about its community?

## A community that Hatena and its users aim to create

Hatena provides platforms for users to post information, such as Hatena
Blog and Hatena Bookmark. Hatena provides these services because it
believes that when users post information, it has a positive impact on
both the users themselves and the recipients, and makes the Internet and
ultimately the world a better place\*1.

That doesn't just mean making sure the content you post is positive and
wonderful. People need a place to share their everyday experiences and
simple thoughts, and sometimes to express negative feelings like anger
or sadness and even to let out their weaknesses. Hatena aims to be a
platform that can accept a variety of expressions from **a variety of
people .**

- \*1: Hatena Mission

The purpose of these guidelines is to inform users of Hatena's values,
way of thinking, and its policy for dealing with various issues, and to
ask for the understanding and cooperation of all users in order to
create a better user community.

Although individual policies may change from time to time, the basic
values are universal. Please read them.

## Values that are important to the Hatena community

Hatena operates its services based on the following values. We also
expect those who use our services to hold these values in mind.

### Respect free expression and healthy communication

Since launching the Hatena Human Search engine in 2001, Hatena has
consistently respected the freedom of expression and communication of
its users, and has aimed to be a forum for diverse expression where
users can access better information and empathize with others through
the service. We also value the **creation and sharing of better wisdom
through discussion among users .**

### Have an attitude of respect, dignity and understanding towards others

In order to have healthy communication, it is necessary **to respect,
honor, and try to understand others who have different opinions** . We
believe that objections and criticisms are also important forms of
communication, but without such an attitude, it will simply be an attack
and hurt to others, which will be unpleasant not only for the parties
involved but also for third parties, and will not be beneficial.

### Maintaining an appropriate distance from different values

Even if you try to behave appropriately as described above, if you are
unable to discuss something or if the other person has unacceptable
values, please follow the "Guidelines for dealing with inappropriate
content" below or use the hide function provided for each service.
Please act in **a way that distances you from the other person, rather
than excluding them .**

Some issues that arise in the community are difficult to resolve
amicably for all involved. Even when such issues arise, we will make
decisions and establish rules in line with the values above, and
continue to make every effort to provide a healthy service.

Hatena is trying to create a good community by valuing communication
between users.

## Guidelines for dealing with inappropriate content

Hatena provides services to spread the ideal community and values we
have introduced above. To that end, there are several rules in place,
including restrictions based on laws and regulations, restrictions for
user safety, and restrictions to maintain the service.

Below are some examples of content and behavior that Hatena considers
inappropriate, so please use them to help you **decide what actions to
take if you come across content on the Hatena site that you find
inappropriate . Please also abide by the rules when posting your own
content.**

### Copyright infringing content

Please use this content in accordance with copyright law. If a copyright
holder notifies us, we will begin procedures in accordance with the
Hatena Information Removal Guidelines. Details

### Privacy Content

We believe that information regarding privacy should be in accordance
with the intentions of the parties involved. Please do not disclose
information related to privacy for the purpose of curiosity or to attack
the parties involved. Learn more

### Child exploitation content

Hatena takes particularly strict measures against content related to the
exploitation of children, such as child pornography, child prostitution,
and child trafficking, including immediate and complete suspension of
use. Learn more

### Dangerous and harmful content

In cases where it is difficult to voluntarily delete dangerous
information based on a warning, such as information about suicide or
medical information that is not based on scientific evidence, and
deletion is considered to have adverse effects, Hatena may insert links
to neutral information sources or appropriate consultation centers.
Details

### Sexual content

Hatena generally prohibits postings related to pornography,
prostitution, or adult entertainment businesses, and cannot be used for
such purposes. However, if it is determined that the main purpose is not
to arouse lewd interest, and that the use is within the scope of normal
human life, no special action may be taken, or the action may be limited
to restricting posting to lists through zoning, or warning the user.
Details

### Offensive content

Generally, expressions that people find offensive are not consistent,
and can vary depending on various factors such as individual preferences
and the viewing situation even for the same individual. For this reason,
we will not delete information simply because it is offensive. However,
depending on the content, we may take measures such as restricting the
display range by removing it from list pages, or zoning for users with
certain attributes or settings in advance.

### Discriminatory content

Hatena prohibits discriminatory expressions based on race, ethnicity,
creed, sex, social status, place of residence, physical characteristics,
medical history, education, property, income, etc. Naturally, we also
strictly prohibit hate speech that includes continuous abusive
expressions based on the above attributes, personal attacks, threats of
violence or harm, or broad calls for exclusion. Details

### Other illegal content

When publishing information on the Internet, in addition to the
above-mentioned Copyright Act and Personal Rights Protection Act, there
are other laws that must be observed, such as the Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Devices Act and the Public Offices Election Act. Content that
violates laws and regulations may not only be subject to transmission
prevention measures, but may also be subject to claims for compensation
and penalties such as fines and imprisonment.

### Defamation / Disparagement / Insult

Please understand that you are responsible for the content of your own
expressions, and if you intend to express something critical, please
re-read the information deletion guidelines and make sure there are no
problems with your expression. Details

### Harassment/Stalking

Repeated assertions against a specific person, such as when an assertion
or counterargument is not accepted, acts of forcing one's favor on
someone and harassing them, or persistent remarks beyond the generally
acceptable range can be nuisances to that person or the community.
Hatena may take measures such as issuing a warning or suspending use
after checking past usage history, etc. Details

### Violation of Terms of Use and Guidelines / Spamming

The Hatena Terms of Use and guidelines for each service have been
established to protect users, the community, and the service, and you
must adhere to them. Due to the nature of the service, you may be unable
to use the service if you unintentionally violate the guidelines or
engage in spam activities, so please be sure to read the guidelines
carefully. Details

### Actions that do not comply with Hatena's instructions

In the event of inappropriate use, Hatena may send a warning. If you do
not comply with the warning, or if you comply with the warning but then
engage in inappropriate use again, we will suspend your use.

### Other inappropriate conduct

Hatena's actions are basically determined based on whether or not the
actions violate the prohibited items listed in the "Hatena Terms of Use"
or the "Guidelines for dealing with inappropriate content" listed below,
and are not taken arbitrarily. However, even for actions that are not
clearly defined, if we carefully consider them in accordance with the
principles of these guidelines and determine that they have a negative
impact on our users, community, or service provision, we will take
action such as issuing a warning or suspending use.

You have to be careful not to post anything bad or do anything that
might bother someone.

## How Hatena detects and responds to inappropriate content

As a general rule, **Hatena does not pre-censor content posted by
users** . Inappropriate content posted will be detected using the
methods listed below. We cannot guarantee that inappropriate content
will always be detected. Furthermore, even if content is deemed
inappropriate, we may refrain from or withhold measures such as making
it private or suspending its use for various reasons.

### Patrol and monitoring by Hatena

We will check posts by mechanical detection and visual inspection.
However, we do not guarantee that we will constantly patrol all posts or
conduct comprehensive monitoring.

### Responses based on reports and inquiries

The service will provide a reporting channel for users as necessary.

We cannot guarantee that we will respond in accordance with the
reporter's wishes. For example, even if multiple users report an issue,
we will not take any special action if the subject of the report is not
subject to action under the Guidelines.

For services that do not have a reporting desk, reports will be accepted
through the customer support desk.

### Legal proceedings

If we receive a request for deletion based on the Provider Liability
Limitation Act, we will comply with the law and respond in accordance
with the guidelines.

Hatena is governed by Japanese law. We will not immediately make content
unpublished in response to a request for removal based on the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (commonly known as DMCA), which is a law of the
United States of America, but will respond in accordance with the ISP
Liability Limitation Act.

### Requests from public institutions

As a general rule, if we receive a request from the police or any
government ministry to remove illegal content, we will comply with that
request.

The above also applies if we receive a deletion request from an
educational institution for the protection of children and students, or
if we receive a deletion request from the Illegal and Harmful
Information Hotline Center.

### Other blacklists provided by public interest organizations, etc.

We may use blacklists provided by external public interest organizations
mainly for automated monitoring of fraudulent use. However, we will only
adopt these lists after thoroughly verifying their neutrality and
fairness.

## Disclosure to users

If we take measures such as suspending use, we will notify you of the
reason by email to your registered email address (unless there is a
method specified for each service). **As a general rule, we will not
take any action without notice, except for some emergency responses** .
If you do not receive the email, please contact us via the inquiry desk.
However, we may not disclose the following types of information.

- Cases where disclosure, such as specific criteria for determining
  whether or not a particular expression is acceptable, may encourage
  inappropriate expressions that fall into a gray area.
- Mainly with regard to the determination of fraudulent use such as
  spam, when information such as whether or not a user is subject to
  determination, or the reasons and criteria for the determination, may
  be misused to avoid determination.
- In cases where multiple identical notifications are sent due to
  unauthorized use of multiple accounts, or a user who has already been
  suspended re-opening and using an account, etc.
- If the reason has already been disclosed in the past, such as if the
  same inappropriate use has been repeated

Hatena tries to deal with rule violations as fairly as possible.

## Towards a better future

The value of Hatena's services is based on the diverse information
dissemination by diverse people. However, various problems arise when
people with different values interact with each other.

While it is easy to understand the measures of limiting the
dissemination of information or avoiding diversity due to the risk of
problems arising, these are options that Hatena would like to avoid as
much as possible.

This is because we **believe that these types of problems are not unique
to web services** , but can occur equally among family and friends, in
local communities and workplaces, and even between nations and ethnic
groups; they are problems that cannot be avoided when people live
together with other people, and are issues that must be seriously
addressed.

If, through the Hatena community, we can **establish ways of thinking,
rules, systems, and methods of disseminating information that will
ultimately lead to mutual understanding and a rich exchange of
information among diverse people, even if they sometimes clash,** then
perhaps this can be shared in a more universal way as wisdom that leads
to coexistence.

This may be a very difficult undertaking, but we would like to make this
happen together with our users, even if it is just a little at a time.
We appreciate your cooperation.

Let's do our best to create a better Internet!
