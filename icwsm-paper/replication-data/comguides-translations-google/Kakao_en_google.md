The company operates its services based on its operating policy to

poster of the sanctions as quickly as possible through in-service
notifications, emails, etc. However, please note that this may not be
the case in cases where urgent protection of other users is required or

not obligated to notify the reporter of the results of the review.

If you are dissatisfied with the results of the application of the
operating policy, you may file an objection through the customer center,

#### 4. Account and service use may be restricted.

If your activity violates related laws, or the relevant terms and
conditions or operating policies, the company may restrict your account
and use of the service to protect other users from harm. Also, please
note that even if it is not specifically related to the operating
policy, any actions that adversely affect the provision of a sound
service environment or cause inconvenience to other users may also be
restricted. In particular, if it is judged to be an abnormal login or a
special usage environment or usage pattern that may violate the terms
and conditions or operating policies is detected, user protection
measures may be taken to restrict and prohibit identical or similar
actions in order to protect the safe activities of users.

The principle is that usage restrictions are gradually restricted from
temporary restrictions to permanent restrictions depending on the degree
of accumulated violations. However, in the case of obvious illegal acts
prohibited by relevant laws such as posting and distributing obscene
content and promoting gambling, or in cases where urgent danger or
damage prevention is required, usage may be restricted immediately and
permanently regardless of the degree of accumulated violations. In
addition, please note that if you cause malfunctions in equipment
related to the integrated service or destruction or confusion of the
system, which adversely affects the provision of the integrated service
or seriously disrupts the stable operation, the company may restrict
usage of your accounts for which such risky activities have been
confirmed. However, if you are dissatisfied with the results of the
measures taken in relation to usage restrictions, you may file an
objection through the customer center.

Please see below for specific details regarding account and service
usage restrictions.

- ① Account usage restrictions
  - \(1\) If a violation of relevant laws, terms and conditions, or
    operating policies is discovered during the account creation or use
    process, account creation, use, or withdrawal may be restricted.
  - \(2\) If an attempt to abnormally create, use, or withdraw an
    account is discovered, use and withdrawal of the account may be
    restricted, or account creation may be restricted to prevent
    continued abnormal creation of the account. If necessary, the
    account may be deleted and re-registration may be restricted, and
    other appropriate restrictions may be implemented.
  - \(3\) Please keep in mind that usage restrictions are gradually
    restricted from temporary restrictions to permanent restrictions,
    but there are also cases where restrictions are permanently imposed
    immediately.
  - \(4\) If an attempt is discovered to use your account abnormally by
    another person, you may be required to enter a password and go
    through additional identity verification procedures to prevent
    unauthorized use of your account by another person.
  - \(5\) In order to prevent unauthorized use of your account by
    others, it is important that you regularly manage your account
    password so that others cannot easily find out your account
    password. Unfortunately, the company cannot be held responsible for
    any disadvantages that arise from neglecting password management,
    and you will have to bear the burden.
- ② Service use restrictions
  - \(1\) If a violation of relevant laws, terms and conditions, or
    operating policies is discovered during the use of an individual
    service, use of the individual service may be restricted. However,
    in the case of clear illegal acts prohibited by relevant laws, such
    as posting and distributing obscene content and promoting gambling,
    or in cases requiring urgent risk or damage prevention, use of the
    entire integrated service may be temporarily or permanently
    restricted for the protection of other users, and in the case of
    users who do not agree to the Kakao Integrated Service Terms and
    Conditions, use of all of the company's services used with a Kakao
    Account may be temporarily or permanently restricted.
  - \(2\) If a violation is discovered, the exposure of the post may be
    restricted or deleted so that other users cannot see the problematic
    post. In addition, in order to prevent continued violations and
    additional damage, use of the relevant service may be partially or
    completely restricted, such as by restricting the writing function
    and not exposing the post.
  - \(3\) Please keep in mind that service use restrictions are
    gradually restricted from temporary restrictions to permanent
    restrictions, but there are also cases where restrictions are
    permanently imposed immediately.

#### 5. The zero tolerance principle applies to sexual crimes against children and adolescents.

The company considers protecting children and adolescents from harmful
Internet environments to be a major responsibility.

We apply a zero-tolerance policy to sexual crimes against children and
adolescents.  
If the relevant operating policy is violated, the strongest sanctions
will be applied to the account and service use, regardless of the degree
of accumulation, and active measures will be taken, such as linking with
legal responses from investigative authorities, if necessary.

a situation where a sexual crime is likely to occur, please report it to

The company will receive your report and promptly take the necessary
action.

children and adolescents, as well as active expressions of intent to use
related content, are subject to the zero-tolerance principle.

and adolescents through various technologies and policies.

**Kakao aims to create a better world through technology and human
connections. Kakao strives to protect users’ freedom of expression for
freer and more diverse connections.** Protecting users’ human rights is
also an important responsibility of Kakao. Kakao is wary of statements
that abuse freedom of expression and threaten the safety of others.  
Kakao will work to eradicate online hate speech.  
We ask for your interest and participation so that Kakao’s hate speech
response policy, as shown below, can be fully implemented and a safe
digital environment can be created for everyone.

- **Kakao opposes acts of discrimination, promotion of prejudice, and
  unilateral insult or exclusion of specific targets based on origin
  (country, region, etc.), race, appearance, disability or disease,
  socioeconomic status and status, religion, age, gender, gender
  identity, sexual orientation, or other identity factors.**
- **Kakao defines hate speech as speech that attacks a specific person
  or group based on such discrimination. Hate speech not only threatens
  the emotional safety of users, but also causes social exclusion and
  physical violence. Hate speech not only suppresses the freedom of
  diverse users to speak out, but also undermines the trust and health
  of our society. Kakao will respond strongly to hate speech that
  undermines the human rights and dignity of users and threatens their
  safety.**
- **Users should be mindful of statements that incite violence against
  specific individuals or groups or that undermine human dignity in
  public spaces within Kakao services. Users can still freely express
  their opinions on public policy or their own beliefs, as long as they
  do not threaten the dignity and safety of others.**
- **Kakao will continue to improve policies, technologies, service
  planning, and design to eradicate hate speech. In addition, we will
  strengthen internal education and monitoring to guard against
  discrimination and hate speech from within.**

The above principles apply only to the public posting area. Personalized
services such as KakaoTalk's private chat space, mail, and Talk Drawer,
as well as non-public community postings, will apply privacy respect as
the top priority. Kakao will strive to create an environment where all
users can safely enjoy freedom of expression.

We ask all users to actively participate in our efforts to create a safe
digital space for everyone.
