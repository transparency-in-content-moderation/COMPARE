# Not respecting people's privacy

Aparat respects people's privacy and recognizes that the only
justification for violating this privacy is to do so in the service of a
higher purpose. Well-known figures are in a special place; But they also
have privacy for their private lives. People should be aware of the
facts related to the ability and suitability of these officials to
obtain or maintain their position or perform their duties; But they do
not have the right to know anything about their private behavior, unless
their behavior is illegal or has more important and wider consequences
than their private life.  
The bottom line is that Aparat operates within a framework that respects
people's right to privacy, treats them fairly, and at the same time,
allows users to publish content that is in the public interest to know.

## Microphones and hidden cameras

Advances in technology have made it easier and safer to use hidden
devices or to record audio and video of people remotely; But this point
has no effect on the correctness or incorrectness of using them.
Correctness, not feasibility, is the criterion for deciding whether or
not to publish a video. The important point in these contents is to
protect the privacy of the people in the picture, in such a way that if
people's faces are shown without their consent and they are mocked or
slandered, their privacy has been violated and such videos cannot be
published. On the other hand, the images of CCTV cameras installed in
different places, if it violates people's privacy or shows a
heartbreaking and violent scene or depicts actions that may cause chaos
or teach illegal actions and also disturb mental security. society, it
will not be possible to publish on the cameras. It is worth noting that
images related to government officials are not prohibited if they are
not found to be slanderous and their publication is for the benefit of
the public interest of the society. However, in such cases, if a report
is sent by the users, due to the high sensitivity, the officials of the
cameras will immediately review such videos so that no one's rights are
lost in any way.

## secretly recording images in public places

People in public places cannot expect the same level of privacy as at
home. Everyone can see them, which means that their video and audio can
be recorded. Generally, images captured in situations where people can
see the cameraman fall outside of the hidden camera rules. On the other
hand, the publication of recorded images of officials' conversations in
public places, even if they do not agree with the recording of the
images, is unimpeded; However, in these cases, the issues and interests
related to the national and psychological security of the society should
be considered. Videos that violate the rules of this section are not
allowed to be published on the cameras.

## Sadness and sadness

Releasing covertly recorded images of identifiable people in distress or
under high stress (eg in hospitals) requires special considerations.
Publishing such images is usually justified only when those people
themselves or someone on their behalf has given permission to do so. In
these cases, if a report is sent, Aparat authorities will carefully and
seriously review the content to prevent the violation of people's
rights.

## Covert recordings of people on private property

On private property, especially the home, people have a right to expect
that their audio and video will not be recorded for public release. Not
violating people's privacy is considered one of the most important
policies of Aparat, and we have been and will continue to be very
careful about this issue.

## Images with the content of recorded phone conversations

Recording phone conversations without people's knowledge, in case their
privacy is violated or reveals people's personal information, is an
example of eavesdropping, and Aparat is very sensitive about releasing
such videos. Telephone calls to governmental organizations and
institutions and recording of conversations in the conditions that
confidential information is not disclosed and in line with the pursuit
of the interests of the society, such as what journalists of various
media do, are unimpeded.

## Violation of people's privacy

This means protecting the rights of an individual who produces photos,
films or videos for home use and private purposes. Copies of these works
may not be distributed without permission; Therefore, videos of this
type, which a person has prepared for personal use, cannot be published
without his permission. For example, if a normal or well-known person's
phone is stolen and the personal and private pictures of this person are
published by people on the cameras, they will be deleted as soon as they
are informed. Aparat pays attention to the privacy of people.

## Publishing private information of people without permission

Do not invade the privacy of others. Sharing content that may contain
private information of people or their private assets is prohibited
without their permission. This information includes the following; but
not limited to:

- Sharing identity and confidential information of people such as: real
  name, location, national code or passwords related to bank accounts,
  user accounts, etc.
- Sharing personal contact information of people such as: phone number,
  address of social network profiles, etc.
- Sharing restricted or protected social network profiles or publishing
  any information from these profiles.
- share content that violates another's privacy; Like streaming live
  without permission from a private environment

Any type of action or omission based on the laws governing the Islamic
Republic of Iran and international laws is an example of publishing or
violating the privacy of individuals, is prohibited and the user account
of the wrong person will be treated in accordance with the provisions of
the Apparat Laws. All consequences and legal or criminal
responsibilities related to the violation of this clause will be the
responsibility of the user and Aparat has no responsibility in this
regard.

# Violence or dangerous or offensive content

Our priority is to create a safe space for content producers and users
of devices. In the meantime, the role of popular reports in keeping this
society safe is very prominent and important. For this purpose, Aparat
trusts each and every one of its users to create a safe and secure
environment; A responsibility that is shared between the Aparat team and
its users. Reading and understanding the rules of publishing content
will help you and us to be more successful in fulfilling this
responsibility.

## Having violent or offensive content

It is clear that the display of violence upsets many people, and in
extremes, it can be accused of desensitizing the viewers of the videos.
Audiences are still worried about violence; Especially violence that is
close to their own experience. Most of the users expect that the display
of violence serves to express a moral or social point.  
It is necessary to pay attention to the issue of which violent scenes
are shown in the range of videos. Regarding the display of violent
scenes in the videos, it must be noted that the option "Inappropriate
content for children" has been activated, and otherwise, such videos are
not allowed to be published on the cameras.  
The important and fundamental principles of published videos that must
be observed are:

- The dead should be treated with respect and should not be shown unless
  there are compelling reasons.
- Showing close-ups should often be avoided.
- Videos should not gratuitously focus on the bloody aftermath of an
  incident or terrorist attack.
- Using violent images for the sake of availability is not acceptable.
- The value of human life and suffering is the same everywhere; Both
  inside and outside the country.
- Showing scenes of people being killed or dying is not justified under
  any circumstances.

### Animal related violence

Aparat is particularly sensitive about the issue of animal violence; But
in the animal world, there is a distinction between aggressive behavior
among conspecifics and predatory attacks from one species to another.
Both types of violence are fundamental components of animal behavior.
Evidence suggests that video viewers are less sensitive to depictions of
animal violence among their own species, such as males fighting for
group dominance. Hunting scenes, which may cause deep discomfort, should
be depicted carefully and without showing unnecessary details.  
In these cases, it should be noted that the reason for the conflict
between animals is not the human factor; It means that humans should not
play a role in conflict between animals. For example, "Khorus Lari"
competitions and the like are not allowed to be published on cameras.
Also, videos containing animal abuse content are not allowed to be
published on cameras because it is extremely disturbing.

### Human violence

The following is a list of things about human violence that are not
allowed to be published on Aparat. It is worth noting that this list
does not include all unpublishable items:

- Situations close to users' own experience
- Videos containing scenes of domestic and sexual violence
- Portraying women and children as victims of sexual violence
- Scenes of extreme and continuous violence (of any kind) - when the
  context of the story creates tension in the viewer; For example, the
  dangling legs of an executed person placed in front of a child's face.
- Suicide, suicide attempt or teaching it
- Introduction of weapons whose use may be imitated; Especially simple
  weapons like knives, hammers, sledgehammers or methods that show how
  violence can be more effective.
- Verbal aggression, especially when the words used are sexually
  charged.

### Harsh content related to children

Evidence shows that violence in situations similar to real life is much
more distressing than violence in fictional and fictional situations.
When violence occurs in a familiar environment and between familiar
faces, children are the most upset; For example, domestic violence
between characters similar to the child's parents or towards people and
tame animals with whom the child sympathizes should not be shown. Of
course, by using the "inappropriate content for children" option, these
considerations can be adjusted to some extent; But the general policy of
Aparat is to protect the rights of children and vulnerable groups.  
The danger of imitation, especially among children, is very real; For
example, regarding the use of karate kicks or the use of easy-to-reach
weapons such as ropes, knives or bottles, extreme care must be taken,
and such videos are not allowed to be published on cameras without
activating the "content unsuitable for children" option.  
Criminal acts, if dramatized, should not become "how-to" lessons. It is
also important not to hide the consequences of violence in real life.

### Violence against women

Violence against women in videos should not promote the idea that women
should be exploited or humiliated through violence, or that women,
except in exceptional cases, are willing victims of violence. Rape is
nothing but a calamity for its victim and any other assumption is
incorrect. Even in videos that have text or words on them and talk about
rape, if they give even a little bit of justice to the rapist or do not
consider the act of rape to be ugly, it will not be allowed to be
published on the cameras.  
Violence against women should not be shown as a sensual experience, and
videos in which the concept of rape is shown in this way are not allowed
to be published. The same sensitivity exists about violence against
children.

## Having content that causes suffering and discomfort

### Pictures related to accidents and disasters

The images that are published should not cause extreme discomfort and
anxiety. Incorrect and alarming estimates about the statistics of
casualties from natural events, pictures of accident victims, without
the plans containing blood and injuries being erased, heartbreaking
scenes and the like, will not be broadcast due to disrupting the peace
of society and causing anxiety.

### Image related to injuries

The images published on the cameras should not cause cruelty to the
heart and disturb the peace of the society; Images that sympathetically
cover such incidents have no problem being published.

### Images of interviews with the injured and bereaved

Those who are in severe distress should not be interviewed against their
will. Publishing pictures of those who are extremely upset should not
increase their suffering and pain. Images that have a news documentary
mode and are prepared about an event, if they are not shocking and
disturbing, there is no problem to publish them.

### Pictures of the dead, injured and missing

Concern for next of kin requires special care regarding videos of
deaths, injuries or missing persons. There may be exceptions for
prominent figures or due to some special circumstances; But otherwise,
care should be taken not to let the close relatives suffer severe
emotional distress from seeing these images. Pictures of the dead or
injured in any incident or accident should be published with the
consideration of erasing the heartbreaking scenes. For example, the
pictures of bodies that are taken out from under the rubble after an
earthquake or a fire are very heartbreaking and should be published with
sensitivity. These images can only be published if the image of the
figures and faces is blurred and cannot be seen clearly.

## Harmful or dangerous activities

Some people have serious grounds for harming themselves or others;
Therefore, publishing content with these themes may encourage these
people to perform such behaviors. Therefore, such videos are not allowed
to be published on cameras. Also, videos in which people attempt to harm
themselves (Self-Harm) or others are not allowed to be published.

# Sensitive content

Our priority is to create a safe space for content producers and users
of devices. In the meantime, the role of popular reports in keeping this
society safe is very prominent and important. For this purpose, Aparat
trusts each and every one of its users to create a safe and secure
environment; A responsibility that is shared between the Aparat team and
its users. Reading and understanding the rules of publishing content
will help you and us to be more successful in fulfilling this
responsibility.

## Content that is unethical, unethical or in conflict with the laws of the country

Aparat, like any platform anywhere in the world, is subject to the laws
of its country; Therefore, regarding the topics of covering, social dos
and don'ts, although there have been changes in society's norms in these
years; Also, the custom of the society and accepted Iranian-Islamic
affairs determine the policy of Aparat. Accordingly, the videos that are
published on Aparat must take into account all Iranian, Islamic and
customary affairs, and users should note that all the activities of
Aparat are within the framework of the laws of the Islamic Republic of
Iran.

## child abuse

Any image of children that raises the suspicion of being in a sexual
situation is not allowed to be published on cameras. All content that is
published on Aparat must take into account the norms, laws and customs
of the society in terms of verbal, visual, sexual violence, gender
innuendo, and the like, so that inappropriate content for children is
not published without activating the "content inappropriate for
children" option. .  
A correct and sensitive approach will prevent the most delicate issues
from being widely considered offensive. Evidence suggests that violence
in situations similar to real life is much more distressing than
violence in fictional and fictional situations. When violence occurs in
a familiar environment and between familiar faces, children are the most
upset; For example, violence at home between characters similar to the
child's parents or towards people and tame animals with whom the child
sympathizes is not allowed. Of course, this red line can be adjusted to
some extent by using the "content inappropriate for children" option;
But the general policy of Aparat is to protect the rights of children
and vulnerable groups.  
The danger of imitation, especially among children, is very real; For
example, regarding the use of karate strikes or the use of easy-to-reach
weapons such as ropes, knives or bottles, users must be extremely
careful. Criminal acts, if dramatized, should not become "how-to"
lessons. It is also important not to hide the consequences of violence
in real life.  
One of the concerns that always exists in various societies is the
"correctness" of displaying children's images. There have always been
many discussions between psychologists and child education specialists
about the way and extent of displaying children's images. An important
point in showing videos where children are the main subject is the issue
of "consent"; That is, during childhood, the consent of the parents is
the condition of this show, and in older ages, the consent of the child
and the teenager.  
Currently, considering that the images published on the cameras remain
on the servers of this platform and may play a role in the child's
future, users should be careful about publishing them. For example, when
an image of a child laborer collecting garbage from the side of the
street is shown, great care must be taken so that the child's face is
not clearly visible.  
Also, when talking about a child who is a victim of sexual rape, it
should be very careful that the child's identity remains hidden, and if
a video reveals the identity of a child who has been raped, it will
definitely not be allowed to be released on the cameras. What the user
should pay attention to before uploading the video to the camera is
whether this video will change the fate of the child in the future or
not. The answer to this question clarifies whether the video is allowed
or not.

## Sexual content

At Aparat, we try to do our work according to the rules, laws, and
certain basic customary issues that apply to showing all sexual
activities. Users should pay enough attention to these points when
uploading videos to their devices:

- Images related to human lovemaking, animal mating, etc., are not
  allowed to be published on cameras.
- If you upload pornographic images and erotic videos, the channel will
  be deleted.
- Videos that talk about sexual issues, if they have an educational,
  medical, research and documentary aspect and do not have an erotic
  form, there is no problem to be published if the option "Inappropriate
  content for children" is activated.
- Videos containing sexual violence or sadism, if the aforementioned
  concepts are used, are not allowed to be published on cameras.
- Videos specific to medical specialties, such as conferences or medical
  services, will be carefully reviewed if reported.

These rules are also true for all the things published in Aparat, such
as the comments section and video descriptions.

## Having content with hateful themes

Aparat's approach to all content uploaded by users is to avoid deleting
videos as much as possible, unless the uploaded content causes
sensitivity, arouses emotions, contains insults, insults, slander and
the like, and ultimately results in disturbing the peace of society. to
be In these cases, Aparat is forced to delete the mentioned uploaded
content.  
Derogatory or disrespectful references (whether verbal or visual) to the
content that is the core of beliefs of different religions (for example,
the cross, the Bible, the Qur'an and the holy days of the followers of
religions), are considered a serious and deep insult, and special care
should be taken in these matters so that the videos Uploaded should not
be offensive to religious and religious minorities.  
Iran is a country consisting of various ethnicities and cultures; Ethnic
groups and cultures that have lived side by side with each other for
hundreds and maybe thousands of years with compromise and tolerance and
have formed the pluralistic society of Iran. On the other hand,
patriotism is an instinctive feeling among all human beings that has
existed in every period of history and every geographical area, and it
is not unique to Iran; But sometimes in some regions, groups and
factions focusing on extreme nationalism cause differences among
different ethnic groups. Any video that leads to chaos and ethnic
differences or creates cultural tensions between people is not allowed
to be broadcast on cameras.  
As a provider of video uploading services, Aparat's policy is based on
the principle that the content uploaded by users should not cause
discord and division among people in any way, and any ethnic and racial
insults that cause discord, revival of previous differences or chaos in
any part of Iran. It will not be allowed to be published in Aparat.

## Advertisement of unauthorized goods or services

Aparat is a platform for advertisements of various businesses, and no
video will be removed from Aparat just because it is an advertisement.
We consider ourselves obliged to respect the interests of the society,
and on the other hand, the implementation of the relevant laws of the
country is one of the basic principles of the work of Aparat. Based on
this, the user should note that it is necessary that any advertising
video is solely for the purpose of advertising for the sale and supply
of specific goods and services, wholesale sales or business introduction
and promotion. If the images or texts contained are in conflict with any
of the terms and conditions and instructions of Aparat, regardless of
the legal responsibilities of the user, it will be removed as soon as
the officials of Aparat are informed of the violation of the video
rules. In the following cases, videos are not allowed to be published on
cameras:

- Advertising videos for buying and selling body parts
- Ads for buying and selling live animals
- Abortion services
- Providing massage services at home
- Advertising videos related to contraband and illegal goods such as
  receivers, eavesdropping devices, etc.
- Promotional videos of products whose trading is prohibited according
  to the laws of the Islamic Republic; such as weapons, explosives, etc.
- Promotional videos of stolen property or goods obtained from
  committing a crime or violating the regulations of the Islamic
  Republic of Iran.
- Advertising videos of drugs and psychedelics, their components or
  accessories and, in general, goods that are dangerous for the
  consumer.
- Promotional videos of products whose transaction has certain
  formalities and legal requirements and regulations; Such as stun gun,
  tear gas, metal detector, etc.
- Advertising videos of goods that are against the social and moral
  values of society or videos that have content and images that are
  against the values of society; Such as pornographic films,
  contraceptives, illegal therapeutic drugs, illegal vitamins, sex
  mannequins and all kinds of illegal sexual accessories.
- Advertisements of dating sites and channels
- Promotional videos for gambling, lottery and betting related products
- Promotional videos related to network, multi-stage, pyramid, matrix
  and similar marketing that do not have a legal license to operate.
- Using inappropriate and offensive words or phrases in the text or
  image of advertising videos
- Advertising videos of products that explain abstract concepts in the
  field of religion and popular beliefs; Such as prayer, talisman,
  magic, fortune, fortune, chance, luck, Yemen, opening affairs, etc.
- Promotional videos of goods related to the country's cultural
  heritage, such as buying and selling antique goods
- Advertising videos of the mentioned prohibited goods on the website of
  the Working Group for Determining Examples of Criminal Content at
  http://internet.ir

Our priority is to create a safe space for content producers and users
of devices. In the meantime, the role of popular reports in keeping this
society safe is very prominent and important. For this purpose, Aparat
trusts each and every one of its users to create a safe and secure
environment; A responsibility that is shared between the Aparat team and
its users. Reading and understanding the rules of publishing content
will help you and us to be more successful in fulfilling this
responsibility.

# Promoting imitative and antisocial behaviors

The viewers of the cameras are worried about the possibility of people
imitating the behavior that is shown on the cameras. At Aparat, we try
to ensure that the anti-social or criminal behavior that is shown is
definitely not imitated.

## Crime and vandalism

Aparat is particularly sensitive about showing criminal methods,
destruction of public property, or the use of weapons. The important
point for users is to avoid showing too many details or ways to perform
such activities more effectively.

## Imitation and children

Children's play is often influenced by the images they see online or on
TV. Today, with the spread of internet platforms, the reference medium
for children is the internet space. In particular videos for children or
videos that are likely to be popular among them, videos that lead to
dangerous imitations are not allowed on the camera. In general, smoking
and drinking should not be shown in children's videos. Videos related to
executions and related events are not suitable for children; Therefore,
any video that contains such scenes must be assigned the option of
"Content not suitable for children", otherwise, it will not be allowed
to be published on Apparatus.  
Innovative and unusual methods of inflicting pain and suffering,
especially when they are easy to imitate using household objects such as
knives or hammers, should not be shown in children's videos. Remember
the danger of children suffocating in plastic bags. If the video shows
dangerous activities such as climbing heights or stunts on motorcycles
and bicycles, it should be warned about the risk of imitating these
activities without the supervision of an informed person, otherwise the
age restriction option should be activated for it. .

## suicide

A real suicide video may encourage others to do the same. Videos must
avoid showing details of suicide methods, otherwise it will not be
allowed to be published on cameras; Especially in cases where the method
used is unusual, users should be extra careful not to post a video
against the rules.  
Regarding the videos of the report that are about suicide, care should
be taken that the content does not teach or encourage suicide. If a
video contains a report or information about the suicide of a child or
student, whatever the content, the age restriction option must be
enabled for it.

## Narcotic substances

Most viewers have many concerns about drug use videos. Real videos aimed
at investigating drug use often require attention to issues such as
identity concealment, child protection, and how drug use is portrayed.  
In these cases, we carefully pay attention to the concept that is
conveyed through the video. Merely showing drug use or talking about it
is not a reason not to be allowed to publish; Rather, it may ultimately
condemn the use of drugs. Videos that advertise and encourage the use of
drugs in any way are not allowed to be published.

## Antisocial behaviors

Harmful behaviors such as smoking should not be portrayed in a way that
leads to anti-social behaviour. For example, if the video content
encourages drinking or smoking in public places, it is not allowed to be
published. Aparat is particularly sensitive about the anti-social
aspects of extreme behavior.

## Bet

Betting is a crime; But it is investigated under the criminal title of
gambling, and when the occurrence of betting punishment is confirmed,
the guilty person will be dealt with according to the law; Therefore,
the relevant legal articles to deal with the crime of gambling and
betting on the results of sports matches, clearly include the crime of
betting.  
Gambling with any means is prohibited and the perpetrators are sentenced
to one to six months in prison or up to 74 lashes, and in case of
gambling, they are sentenced to both punishments. Gambling is the same
crime as the uploading of betting and gambling videos on cameras;
Therefore, all videos related to gambling and betting will not be
allowed to be published on cameras; However, if there are images of
betting and gambling in a movie or series, or if there is an image
related to betting in a news report or the like, it is not prohibited to
publish it. In these cases, it should be noted that teaching,
persuading, encouraging, and normalizing betting affairs or buying and
selling its tools and equipment is against the law, and videos with
these themes cannot be published on cameras.

## Emerging sciences and cults

Demonstrating hypnosis and the use of otherworldly sciences to dominate
humans is not at all pleasant for children, and at a young age when
children's attitudes and worldviews are being formed, any such content
endangers the process of child education; Therefore, care should be
taken when showing such videos so that the videos must have the "not
suitable for children" option and the age restriction option is
activated for them.  
Displaying images related to exorcism is not allowed on cameras, due to
the bad effects it has on users, especially children. The images related
to this ceremony will be deleted as soon as the user reports.  
Note that in a significant number of these videos, religious rituals are
mocked and in the religious society of Iran, this is unacceptable and
distasteful.  
Many families have serious concerns about the spread of emerging sects.
In religious communities, these concerns are twofold, and one of the
most controversial issues in this field is Satanism, which has various
types and sects; But in general, they all have a lot in common. Videos
related to satanic groups or containing satanic themes are not allowed
to be published on Aparat. Regarding other videos related to emerging
sects, Aparat seeks to ensure people's psychological and social safety
with great care and sensitivity.

## Cyber crimes

Since the mid-90s, with the expansion of international networks and
satellite communications, the third generation of computer crimes, under
the title of "cyber crimes" or "crimes in the cyber environment" was
formed. In this way, Internet crimes can be considered complementary to
computer crimes; Especially the crimes of the third generation of
computers, which are known as crimes in the virtual environment, mostly
take place through this global network.  
The types of criminals in the virtual environment include: hackers,
crackers, phone freaks and types of possible crimes known as
"cybercrime". Such actions include the following; but not limited to:

- Learn to send large amounts of duplicate, spam or abuse reports
- Training on the distribution of unauthorized advertisements
- Phishing training
- Learning to deceive people or scam them
- Malware or virus spreading training

Publish video with these topics in Aparat will not be allowed.

Our priority is to create a safe space for content producers and users
of devices. In the meantime, the role of popular reports in keeping this
society safe is very prominent and important. For this purpose, Aparat
trusts each and every one of its users to create a safe and secure
environment; A responsibility that is shared between the Aparat team and
its users. Reading and understanding the rules of publishing content
will help you and us to be more successful in fulfilling this
responsibility.

# National security considerations

In any society exposed to terrorism, gossip can be deadly. Aparat's role
is to provide a platform for the publication of content produced by
users, provided that this content does not conflict with national
interests. In a critical situation, the release of videos containing
rumors may harm the mental peace of the community to a great extent. In
the discussion of issues related to terrorism, it should be noted that
simply uploading content related to Iran will not be a decision
criterion, even if a terrorist group or group is active in the
Philippines or Chile, uploading images related to these groups in
cameras is prohibited; Because it may be a platform for spreading the
thoughts of these groups, without the audience being inside Iran. On the
other hand, the disturbing effects of the activities of terrorist groups
are always against a concept called "sense of security", in such a way
that even if Iranian users are not exposed to these terrorist acts, such
content still harms people's sense of security.

## Release of confidential documents

Preventing the publication of confidential documents and information is
directly proportional to maintaining national security. In cases where
there is a suspicion of the confidentiality of the release of some
information, as soon as the users report it, the authorities will review
the reported video and if the published content clearly or implicitly
contains information and documents that are classified as confidential,
secret, or top secret. And like this, the video will not be allowed to
be published in Aparat.

## Terrorist threats

One of the methods of terrorist groups to carry out psychological
operations is to create terror in the society. In the past and before
the formation of interactive media, news agencies sometimes received
phone calls from people claiming to be bombings.  
Currently, with the emergence of interactive media and the provision of
content uploading platforms by users, a major part of this psychological
operation has been transferred to these platforms and social networks.
When such videos are uploaded to the devices by users, they will be
allowed to be published only if the video is uploaded by an official
military security institution and is valid, and otherwise, as soon as
the content is reported by the users or competent authorities. The video
will be removed from Aparat, and if there is any anti-national security
content, Aparat reserves the right to follow up with legal authorities.

## Showing people or information about people at risk

Usually, videos containing threats against specific people are not
allowed to be published on cameras. Also, a video showing secret and
confidential information about the life of a political, military and
judicial official is not allowed to be released on cameras; Things like
the exact location of the activity, detailed maps, aerial images,
readable views of license plates, etc. These cases usually make up a
very small percentage of camera videos; But in the case of a report,
Aparat will not be indifferent to it and will not simply pass it by,
even if such cases are observed only once in our entire working life.

## Speech of terrorists

The content produced by terrorist groups is often produced for the
purpose of propaganda or intimidation, and part of the images used in
these videos are the speeches of high-ranking members of terrorist
groups and their intellectual leaders. The camera is very accurate and
sensitive when dealing with such videos.  
If a part of the speech of a member or leader of a terrorist group is
included in a video report, we will make sure that this use of images is
for the benefit of the people or the importance of its existence is more
than the anger and hatred that its display may cause among the people.
For example, if a part of Abdul Malik Rigi's speech is in a video,
seeing this person's face and hearing his voice is disturbing for the
people of Iran, especially the people of Sistan and Baluchistan; but
showing this speech along with additional explanations and
clarifications may prevent groups from joining. be a similar
terrorist.  
In such cases, the video will be allowed to be published; But the
general process of our work in Aparat is such that we will strictly deal
with the publication of content that may serve terrorist groups, and
users are not allowed to publish such content.

# Offensive content

Our priority is to create a safe space for content producers and users
of devices. In the meantime, the role of popular reports in keeping this
society safe is very prominent and important. For this purpose, Aparat
trusts each and every one of its users to create a safe and secure
environment; A responsibility that is shared between the Aparat team and
its users. Reading and understanding the rules of publishing content
will help you and us to be more successful in fulfilling this
responsibility.

## slander

It doesn't matter if defamation of people, organizations or groups in
the description, caption or on the images is written or verbal, in any
case, it is forbidden to publish content containing slander and
defamation on the devices; Regardless of who made this slander and
slander, and it doesn't matter if this content is published by
established channels or a newly established channel. At Aparat, we have
a specific basis for judging the slander and slander of the content, in
this situation, when a content is reported by users as slander and
slander, we ask ourselves these questions about the reported content:

- Does this speech humiliate a person in the eyes of wise people?
- Does it expose him to hatred, ridicule or hostility?
- Does it expose him to hatred, ridicule or hostility?
- Does it hurt his job and career?

Then, in response to these questions, we pay attention to these issues:

- **Truth:** The content and speech may be true.
- A fair comment on a matter of general interest: it may be shown that
  this speech is an honest opinion based on verifiable facts, it is not
  caused by enmity and malice, and its proposal will be in the interest
  of the public.
- Publication in official platforms: the statements made during the
  broadcast of public negotiations of the court or the Islamic Council
  and public circles are different from the expression of personal
  opinions; That is, users are normally allowed to publish statements
  made as part of parliament negotiations or court proceedings, in some
  government documents, or while attending circles that are open to the
  public.

Most of the time, these reviews have certain complications, and if we
report a video, we evaluate the reported content by considering all
these complications. If a user feels that a person or group has been
defamed, it is recommended to report these cases so that Aparat can
evaluate them as soon as possible and make a decision about whether the
said statement includes cases of violation of laws or not.

Cases of defamation of trade names and brands will also be considered.
The publication of cases of defamation regarding the brand does not make
Aparat responsible; However, if a request is submitted by the brands
that have been defamed, these cases will be carefully examined so that
the legal process can be carried out regarding them.

## Using offensive language

A rude tone is a matter of great concern to many people and one of the
most common causes of public reports. Sometimes it may be difficult to
judge the rude tone in the video, in these cases, if users report it,
Aparat will check it carefully. This issue is different from the issue
of using profanity. Regarding the use of profanity in videos, it should
be kept in mind that all profanities used in adult literature, in
addition to profanity, cannot be published in English.

Humor and comedy are often more tolerated and have a special license.
However, humor and comedy should be measured, not cruel or designed to
offend or humiliate an individual or group. The prevalence of bad mouth
in the society does not justify the lack of taste in these issues;
Therefore, videos that have humorous content, but during which an
individual or a group is insulted, will not be published. This
sensitivity will be more about the issues related to politicians and
military and country officials.

When jokes about physical or mental disability are made, there is a risk
that they will be deeply uncomfortable for some and offensive to the
larger group; Therefore, videos like this are not allowed to be
published on Aparat. Even when there is no malicious intent, the joke
may appear to use the humiliation of others as a form of entertainment.

## Insulting the authorities

In this section, it should be noted that talking about political figures
is not a problem as long as they are not openly insulted or accused or
falsely attributed to them. It should be noted that the basic principle
in dealing with the content in the cameras is to preserve national
security. If the words are compiled in such an unrealistic way that it
causes chaos in the society or insults a political group, it will not be
possible to publish in the media.  
The use of language in the description of videos is very important. Some
words or phrases have a special burden; For example, the use of the word
"betrayal" requires special care. It is against the rules of the
apparatus to attribute "traitor" or "influencer" to political persons,
former and current government officials, without a competent court
having issued a ruling about it.

## Stereotypes/mockery/racial and ethnic insults

Aparat's approach to all content uploaded by users is to avoid removing
videos as much as possible, unless the uploaded content causes
sensitivity, arouses emotions, contains insults, insults, slander and
the like and ultimately results in disturbing the peace. society, in
these cases Aparat will be forced to remove the said content.  
Derogatory or disrespectful references, verbal or visual, to the content
that is the core of beliefs of various religions (for example, the
cross, the Bible, the Koran and the holy days of the followers of
religions) are considered a serious and deep insult, and special care
should be taken in these matters so that the uploaded videos are not To
insult religious and religious minorities.

Iran is a country consisting of various ethnicities and cultures; Ethnic
groups and cultures that have lived side by side with each other with
compromise and tolerance for hundreds or maybe thousands of years and
have formed the pluralistic society of Iran. On the other hand,
patriotism is an instinctive feeling among all human beings that has
existed in every period of history and every geographical area, and it
is not unique to Iran; But sometimes in some regions, groups and
factions focusing on extreme nationalism cause differences among
different ethnic groups. Any video that leads to chaos and ethnic
differences or creates cultural tensions between people is not allowed
to be broadcast on cameras.

As a provider of video uploading services, Aparat's policy is based on
the principle that the content uploaded by users should not cause
discord and division among people in any way, and any ethnic and racial
insults that cause discord, revival of previous differences or chaos in
any part of Iran. It will not be allowed to be published in Aparat.

In Aparat, we take special sensitivity into account of jokes and jokes
related to people's race, religion, age or gender. Remember that groups
of people who are the target of such jokes may be offended. Using
stereotypes in videos requires careful thinking; Therefore, videos that
contain content related to ethnically offensive jokes or make offensive
jokes with gender are not allowed to be published.

The mere presence of content such as "some day, some day and..." as long
as it is not offensive, there is no problem to publish it.

# copyright

Our priority is to create a safe space for content producers and users
of devices. In the meantime, the role of popular reports in keeping this
society safe is very prominent and important. For this purpose, Aparat

## Copyrighted videos

Copyright laws have been created to protect and enforce the rights of
creators and original owners of works such as books, movies and songs.
Copyright is one of the most complex legal issues affecting videos.
While these rules seem recognizable; It has many complications. As a
result, there are no simple answers to some copyright questions.  
The copyright laws in Iran are not very clear. The Law on the Protection
of the Rights of Authors, Authors and Translators, which was approved by
the National Council in January 1348, is the legal basis for this field,
and Aparat, considering the seriousness that it attaches to the
observance of copyright for content producers, has clarified
instructions for these cases. has done Obviously, this instruction is
not all that is necessary to comply with the copyright, and it has been
compiled only according to the cases that have occurred so far, and in
the future it may be added or subtracted from these cases. The official
channel of the video producer has the right to publish all or part of
its produced content; This means that the official channels of content
producers can publish their content as much as they want, and there is
no prohibition from Aparat or any other authority in these cases. But if
the video publisher is a channel other than the official channel
producing that content, the duration of the published video should not
be more than two (2) minutes. If the duration of the copyrighted videos
is more than this, the related video will not be allowed to be published
on the cameras. It is important to note that the release of the official
trailer of the series or movie on other channels is unimpeded; But it
should be noted that the shortened content does not spoil or load the
story of the movie or series. Also, in unofficial channels, in the video
description or caption section, if there is a link to download a movie
or series illegally, it will not be allowed to be published on devices
due to the violation of copyright laws. All videos that have value added
in any way, such as dubbing, subtitles, etc., if done by domestic legal
institutions, will be subject to copyright laws. Any group operating
legally in the country and producing content or adding value to the
produced content (such as dubbing or subtitles) is subject to copyright
laws. Also, any domestically produced film or series is subject to
copyright laws.  
What is referred to as "Fair Usage" in the world is publishing content
in a way that does not violate copyright laws. Currently, the basis for
deciding about fair use is to consider the duration of 120 seconds in
the maximum mode, provided that the loading mode does not find the story
or spoiler and also does not violate other rules of publishing content
on devices.

## Copyrighted music

The music produced inside the country, due to the individual property
rights of the producer or artist, cannot be played in full on the
devices. For example, you cannot download licensed music album tracks
without permission from the intellectual owner of the work; But using
these musics as background music or a section for videos will not
violate copyright laws. Note that the following are not included in this
classification:

- Videos containing dramatic-musical works
- Musical satires and comedies

However, due to the lack of a specific law on copyright, basically,
there will not be much strictness in this section on the part of Aparat,
unless the intellectual owner of the work officially wants to remove the
content under his ownership from Aparat.
