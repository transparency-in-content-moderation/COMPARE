# Niconico Activity Guidelines

## 1. Niconico is a platform where anyone can freely express themselves.

Niconico is a service that allows people to freely post content online
in the form of videos, live broadcasts, blogs, etc., and allows people
who view that content to add their own comments.

It is a place where anyone can express their thoughts and work equally,
regardless of the artist's race, gender, age, organization affiliation,
or past career history.

Niconico will also keep its restrictions on the content of users'
expressions to a minimum.

We hope that by doing so, many wonderful works will be created,
discussion on specific themes will be deepened, and the unique culture
of the Internet will further develop.

All users who use NicoNico understand this policy and agree to all items
1 to 5 of these guidelines before using the service.

## 2. People who participate in NicoNico activities respect each other's autonomy and resolve issues between the parties involved.

Anyone who publishes content on NicoNico has the rights and
responsibility for that content.

We must also recognize each other's rights and responsibilities and
respect each other's autonomy.

Therefore, if a problem arises where the content you have published has
caused harm to someone or infringed on their rights, the parties
involved should generally resolve the issue between themselves.

## 3. Freedom of expression through content is not unlimited

As stated in the previous paragraph, if any problems arise due to
published content, the general rule is that the parties involved must
resolve the issue between themselves, and Niconico will keep
restrictions on expression to a minimum; however, there are some cases
in which we will not allow the content to be posted.

In particular, Niconico may delete content that falls under the
following categories at its sole discretion:

**\<Crime and illegal activities\>**

example)

- Predicts murder or terrorism by specifying the date, time, place, and
  method
- Advertisement of illegal items such as drugs, weapons, and bombs
- Soliciting prostitution or compensated dating
- Submit a movie you secretly filmed at the theater
- Content that constitutes child pornography or child abuse
- Content that amounts to animal cruelty

**＜Acts of violating the rights of others＞**

example)

- Content that violates the honor, social credibility, reputation, or
  privacy of others
- Content that infringes on the fundamental human rights, intellectual
  property rights such as copyrights, or other rights of others.

**＜Things that are contrary to public order and morals＞**

example)

- Sexual content
- Violent content
- Content equivalent to involvement in suicide (invitation,
  solicitation, cooperation, instigation)

**\<Anything else that Niconico deems inappropriate\>**

## 4. We do not tolerate interference with the expression of others.

Niconico has a truly unique and diverse comment culture, where users can
share their feelings by commenting on content, show respect and love for
creators, and liven up the mood with barrages of comments.

Comments are NicoNico's greatest feature, and NicoNico is committed to
preserving that culture.

On the other hand, comments should not hinder the expression of others
or discourage those who wish to express themselves.

If the comment is unwelcome to the person who posted the content or to
those who enjoy watching it, Niconico may delete the following comments
at its own discretion, in order to protect the poster's freedom of
expression.

**\<Comments that constitute crimes or illegal acts\>**

example)

- Predicts murder or terrorism by specifying the date, time, place, and
  method
- Advertisement of illegal items such as drugs, weapons, and bombs
- Soliciting prostitution or compensated dating

**\<Comments that infringe on the rights of others\>**

example)

- Comments that violate the honor, social credibility, reputation, or
  privacy of others
- Comments that infringe on the fundamental human rights, intellectual
  property rights such as copyrights, or other rights of others

**\<Comments that violate public order and morals\>**

example)

- Sexual comments
- Violent comments
- Comments that correspond to involvement in suicide (invitation,
  solicitation, cooperation, instigation)

**\<Comments that hurt the creator of the content in question and the
users (viewers) who agree with that content\>**

example)

- Comments that are defamatory, insulting, threatening or harassing
- Comments that are offensive, disgusting, or psychologically damaging,
  or that are likely to be so

**\<Comments that leak or spread personal information\>**

example)

- Comments that include or may include personal information of others
- Comments that impersonate other people or falsely represent
  organizations

**\<Comments putting pressure on artists as a group\>**

example)

- Comments made by groups that include slander, insults, threats, or
  harassment of others, as well as comments that cause or have the
  potential to cause discomfort, disgust, or emotional harm to others.
- Comments made by individuals or a small number of people pretending to
  be a group

**\<Other comments that Niconico deems inappropriate\>**

## 5. Don't expect too much from Niconico's management.

Niconico supports the diverse expressive activities of its users, and
will establish a specialized operational system to address inappropriate
content and comments.

However, we cannot guarantee that Niconico management will examine or
make any judgments on the content of "all" of the millions of pieces of
content and comments posted every day.

If content or comments that you find offensive or inappropriate are not
deleted, this does not mean that Niconico management condones such
content.

Even when we receive a report about certain content, we may reserve
judgment or decide not to make a judgment depending on various
circumstances, such as when the basis for claiming it is illegal is
unclear, when there is insufficient information to determine that it is
against public order and morals, when a declaration from the rights
holder himself/herself in the case of copyright or other infringement
cannot be confirmed, when the facts of the infringement are unclear, or
when a resolution between the parties involved is desirable.
