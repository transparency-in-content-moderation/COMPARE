# Community Rules

VKontakte is a platform where millions of users share news and
creativity, communicate and express themselves.

Join groups, develop a business or start a personal blog. Hold contests,
organize events, find like-minded people - there are countless
opportunities open to you in communities. And to make sure you and other
users of the platform feel as comfortable as possible, follow the rules
below.

## Navigation

- Questionable and prohibited content

- Non-thematic invitation mailings
- Competitions and promotions
- Advertising Violations and Restrictions
- Rules for the placement of goods and services

## What has changed?

- The restrictions on the number of advertising publications per day
  have been lifted, and the ban on advertising in pinned posts has been
  lifted. Advertising in stories is also allowed, and in the "
  **Services** " section you can post advertising prices for the
  community.
- The restrictions on changing the topic have been relaxed: now you can
  change the topic to any one, as long as it is not on the prohibited
  list.
- The rules for competitions and promotions have become simpler: now the
  condition for participation in a competition can be a subscription to
  the community, mailing list and notifications at the same time. You
  can also ask to tag one friend (no more than one mention from one user
  per competition).

## Questionable and prohibited content

### Prohibited content

There are certain restrictions on **the content published in
communities** . This is primarily information, the posting of which is
prohibited not only by the rules of the site, but also by the
legislation of the Russian Federation and international legal acts. Such
violations include not only obvious ones (for example, paid offers of
intimate services), but also the remote sale of tobacco products. If you
are not sure whether it is legal to post content, you should consult
with lawyers.

### Blockings at the request of copyright holders

The community has been blocked **for violating the rights of third
parties** (at the request of the copyright holders).

The community may be blocked **for violating the rights of third
parties** at the request of the copyright holders in the following
cases:

1\. When group leaders sell certain products of famous brands. The fact
is that many products, services, company names and even just words are
registered as trademarks. The owner of the trademark has the exclusive
right to use it to sell their products or services.

**Important:** We carefully check all documents provided by the
copyright holder. If you have permission to use the trademark, in case
of problematic situations, contact the copyright holder directly or
VKontakte **Support** .

**2.** When community leaders pose as **official representatives** of a
particular organization. Users who are interested in a particular
company or institution are interested in receiving **up-to-date and
reliable** information. Therefore, upon an official request from
representatives of the organization itself, a “fake” community may be
blocked.

### Possible blocking by court order and Roskomnadzor

VKontakte is under **Russian jurisdiction** and also complies with the
laws of all countries where our products are presented. Therefore, for
example, we do not have the right to ignore the official requirements
**of Roskomnadzor** .

If Roskomnadzor considers any content as prohibited, information about
the community is entered into a special registry, and we receive **a
blocking request** , which we are obliged to fulfill within the time
period established by law. In this case, the communities are blocked
forever, and the only solution to this issue may be your appeal to
Roskomnadzor to find a compromise. We do not act as an intermediary in
communication with government agencies.

You can contact Roskomnadzor representatives via email at:
**zapret-info@rkn.gov.ru** . Please note: in the letter you need to
indicate not only the short address (the subdomain name you selected),
but also the digital ID of the community.

**Important** : after blocking a community, it is excluded from the
above-mentioned registry. However, this does not mean that the community
can be unblocked, and does not cancel the fact that there is prohibited
content. Unblocking is only possible upon an official request from
Roskomnadzor to VKontakte with a withdrawal of the request. We do not
have the right to take into account any other documents, including the
agency's responses to your email.

### Unverified Charitable Collections

Communities that conduct charity collections must meet the requirements
described in the FAQ. Remember, **gratitude** is not only warm words
addressed to those who help to get closer to an important goal, but also
**responsibility** to those who provide assistance.

## Prohibited Services and Community Development Methods

### How is it forbidden to promote a community?

There are different ways to find new subscribers. For example, without
any budgets at all: hold contests or create interesting content and get
into recommendations with it. Another option is paid promotion with the
help of targeted advertising. The details are given here:

Growing a community without breaking the rules is an important and
responsible task for every community leader. Share with your team a list
of prohibited promotion methods. These include:

• Spam

• Bot pages

• Cheating

• Violations during competitions and promotions

• Change of subject to one of the prohibited ones

• Non-thematic invitation mailings

### Spam

Spam is the sending of advertising or other information using tools that
are not intended for advertising. For example, spam through friend
requests, personal messages, comments is prohibited **.**

### Bot pages

It is prohibited to create or purchase additional accounts for **sending
spam** in any form. Such profiles are considered bot pages and are
subject to blocking.

### Cheating

Boosting is an artificial increase in community activity indicators
using bots, hacked users, malware or social exchanges. Social exchanges
are external sites that organize users to join communities for a small
reward.

Using cheating may result in the community being **permanently blocked**
.

### Changing the topic to one of the prohibited ones

You can choose any new topic, as long as it is not on the list of
prohibited ones. However, remember about your audience - it needs to be
prepared for the changes, otherwise many subscribers may leave the
community because the content has become completely different. To ensure
that the change goes smoothly and you maintain the loyalty of the public
members, announce the news in advance. This way, subscribers will not
have to guess where an unfamiliar community appeared in their feed.

**The following topics are prohibited from changing:**

1.  **Business** , **commerce** .
2.  **Politics** .
3.  **Groups of organizations** , including public ones.
4.  **Pornography** .
5.  **Contest communities** , consisting entirely of distribution of
    gifts, stickers and other valuables for joining, reposting, inviting
    friends to the same group and similar tasks. The prizes themselves,
    as a rule, are not given out, and as soon as there are many
    participants, the topic in the community changes to another. The
    reverse change **from a contest** topic to **any other** is also
    **prohibited.**
6.  **Selling votes** . There is only one way to buy votes: buy them in
    your profile settings.
7.  **Pseudo-administration of the site** . Attempts to pass off the
    community as an official representative of the administration are
    prohibited - such actions mislead users.
8.  **Shocking content:** This is material that shows violence or
    cruelty with the purpose of shocking the user or causing disgust.
9.  Other topics that violate **the rules** and **legislation of the
    Russian Federation.** Communities that violate the legislation of
    other countries may be blocked for viewing on the territory of these
    countries at the request of their government agencies.
10. Communities created for the purpose of **deception** or
    **misleading** .

## Non-thematic invitation mailings

Event leaders can **invite** members of the community listed as the
organizer to join the community. For example, official bands of
musicians can send out invitations to concerts to subscribers, and
universities can announce alumni reunions.

Providing services for sending invitations for third-party events is
**inviting** . It, like **non-thematic mailings of invitations** to
recruit participants, is considered spam. Mentions of inviting in
advertising price lists of communities can also lead to blocking.

## Competitions and promotions

When holding competitions and promotions in communities, follow the
rules to avoid blocking the community.

It is prohibited to use conditions that lead to artificial **inflated
activity indicators** : for example, inflating the number of "Likes" or
the number of community members. This is stipulated in points **6.3.6**
, **6.3.16 of the rules** .

### General provisions for all types of competitions and promotions

• It is prohibited to hold competitions **without a pre-specified
prize** . Each stated prize must be raffled off.

• **It is imperative to publish the results of the promotion within the
stated time frame** . If no information about the winner appears or the
entry with the competition is deleted before the results are announced,
the community may be blocked. We recommend that you always indicate the
date of the results announcement, as well as a link to the winner's
profile or his first and last name.

• **The community leader** cannot become the winner of a competition
held in his community, with the exception of creative contests, where
the winner is chosen by voting.

### Permitted conditions of competitions

- **Creative competitions.** For example: come up with the best poem,
  draw the most beautiful graffiti, guess the riddle before anyone else.
- **Competitions with conditions from the list:**
  - Like the contest post **;**
  - **Share** the contest post on your page or in stories;
  - **Tag one friend** (no more than one mention from one user per
    contest) **;**
  - **Leave a comment** under the competition post;
  - **Subscribe to the community** where the entry about the competition
    was published, to its **mailing list** , to **notifications** about
    new publications in it, suggest the community in
    **recommendations;**
  - **Subscribe to one sponsor** , their **newsletter** or
    **notifications;**
    - Since 18.01.2023, an experiment has been conducted, within the
      framework of which the number of sponsors within VKontakte is not
      limited for verified communities with a number of participants
      from 100 thousand people. The competition must be held directly in
      the verified community; it is not possible to create a separate
      group for the competition.
- **Contests for activity in the community** For example, evaluate
  participants by the "Like" marks left or the comments written. All
  activity should not go beyond the community. For example: "Those who
  collect the most points will receive prizes. For each "Like" mark
  placed in our group, 1 point is awarded, for each comment written - 2
  points."

### Prohibited conditions for competitions with prizes

- The promotion will end when **a certain value of any counter is
  reached** : the number of community members, likes, shares, etc. Also,
  it is impossible to announce an increase in the prize fund if the
  counter reaches a certain value. Example: *"We will raffle off a car
  when the post gets a million reposts* . "
- The winner will be determined **by the number of "Shared" or "Like"
  marks** under the competition repost on their page. Example: *"The
  winner will be the one who collects the most likes and reposts under
  the copy of the competition post on their own wall* . "
- **Encouragement** **targeted attraction of users to the community** ,
  including personal messages, sending invitations to a public page or
  event. For example: *"Invite N friends to the group", "Write personal
  messages to N people".*
- **Changes to the competition conditions** during the drawing.

**It is also prohibited to** : reward for reposts, require a set number
of likes and comments, or be active outside the competition community.

## Advertising Violations and Restrictions

### Where can I place my ads?

Third-party advertising can be published in clips, stories, on the
community wall and in the link block. Full rules for placing advertising
in communities are set out in the site rules: points 5.13.4 and 5.13.5.

### What are the limits on advertising?

There are no limits. However, do not forget that users join the
community primarily for interesting content. Subscribers are unlikely to
remain in the community, where only advertising is published. In the
short term, this is a good opportunity to earn money, but you risk
quickly losing your audience.

### What is considered advertising

Any publications, including competition ones, that promote another
community, website, products or services.

### Advertising in community messages

A community can use **a chatbot** to send messages to subscribers
automatically.

Community mailings should be related to its topic. A group of a brand,
store or organization can send out messages about new promotions,
products, interesting events. Mailings should not contain any kind of
advertising, including promotion of their representative offices on
other platforms.

### Restrictions on the content of advertising publications

According to paragraph 5.13.5. of the rules, all third-party
advertisements must comply with paragraphs 1 and 3 of the rules for
placing advertisements on VKontakte.

Below we have compiled an adapted list of objects prohibited from
advertising by law, as well as creatives that are questionable in the
opinion of the administration, the promotion of which may lead to
restrictions for the community. Advertising is prohibited:

1.  Using creatives containing:

- **Inflated, unsubstantiated promises** : *“Find out who your partner
  is cheating on you with”* , *“Earn a million a week with options”* .

  the promoted service or product: *"Ekaterina: Up to 3 kg of fat was
  lost in a day! I mixed 1 spoon of soda in a glass and cheap... Read
  more: (link to the website of the weight loss product)."*
- Distortion of the essence of news **by** **omissions,** speculation on
  the topic of **tragic events** (murder, suicide, death, terrorist
  attack), as well as **provocative content** that is misleading or
  intended to shock users.
- Vulgar and unaesthetic images, shock content, pornography, themes of
  child sexuality, any sexual fetishes, explicit erotica, including
  drawn, as well as any other attractions using **the theme of sex and
  sexuality** .
- Themes of **physical disabilities** , body structure features,
  physiological processes and diseases, as well as the use of
  unattractive and unaesthetic images, including drawn ones.

  advertising object are not available immediately and without hindrance
  and in one click.

    promotions;

8.  **Narcotic substances** ;
9.  **Casinos** and **other forms of gambling** , including betting,
    bookmakers, sports betting (and eSports), and related forecasting
    services.

*The exception is poker. Following international developments and trends
in the game, our platform recognizes poker as an intellectual and
commercial game, the result of which depends on the player's mental
abilities, logical thinking, experience and professionalism. Therefore,
poker advertising should not:*

- *- contain statements that exaggerate the likelihood of winning;*
- *- create the impression that winning is guaranteed or that
  participation in intellectual and commercial games is a way of earning
  a living.*

    in the user;
